"""The wire-fact record lives in this repo and is cited by its in-repo path.

The record is `docs/api-contract.md` plus the app statics it cites
(`docs/webapi-spec.md`); each carries a banner saying it is maintained here.
That is what makes this repo self-contained: the protocol layer is vendored
because it has to execute here, and the document that explains it travels with
the code for the same reason.

These checks keep that arrangement honest:

- no tracked text cites the retired `api-notes.md`;
- the shipped code, tests and tool cite the in-repo `docs/` paths; an external
  checkout is never presented as the place to read a wire fact;
- each record file still carries its banner;
- no shipped code, test or tool points at agent-facing or local-only
  files: `AGENTS.md`, the retired `.clinerules/` and `memory-bank/` names,
  and the local `notes/` directory are never cited there.
