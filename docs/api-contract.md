# Smartbox API contract (`api-contract.md`)

The API-contract form of the pre-contract notes. Scope: the wire contract this
integration implements (REST + websocket transports + write semantics),
observed on live hardware and cross-checked against the decoded vendor apps
and the `smartbox` library's client. The full
vendor-API surface (including schedule UI conversion and the local-LAN
API) remains in `webapi-spec.md`; endpoint shapes are cited from it by
reference rather than duplicated. The pre-contract notes held the raw diary —
this file is the citable contract distilled from them.

## Provenance tags (THE rule)

Every claim in this file carries AT LEAST ONE tag; compound claims may
carry several (a `[code]` + `[live]` pair, plus a `[superseded]` note
where applicable):

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[live YYYY-MM-DD]` | Observed on the wire against real hardware on that date; may carry an inline qualifier (`user-verified`, `web-app decode`, `integration round`) narrowing HOW it was observed (see §8 for the evidence trail). |
| `[code file:line]` | As implemented in the retired `smartbox` library at commit `807e873` (read 2026-10-14): `src/smartbox/<file>` is the client this integration's protocol layer replaces. This tag never names this repository. |
| `[doc webapi-spec.md §N]` | Statically extracted from the vendor app bundle; not independently wire-verified here. |
| `[doc: pre-contract notes, <section or date>]` | A provenance mark for the pre-contract diary this file replaced. The notes file does not ship; the durable claim lives in this file. |
| `**[unverified]**` | Assumed, inferred, or never tested. Visually loud on purpose: an unverified claim must LOOK unverified. Do not strip the tag when citing. |
| `[superseded: claim -> evidence]` | An older recorded claim that newer evidence contradicted; kept only to prevent regression. |
| `[file:line]` | As implemented in THIS repository (`custom_components/smartbox/`, the protocol and core layers), with a path resolvable from the repo root. |
| `[app helki.js@<offset>]` / `[app mobile app.js@<offset>]` | Byte-offset excerpt from a decoded vendor-app bundle — `[app helki.js@N]` = the web build of the Helki SPA (`app.helki.com.app.611c74a6`, obfuscated, single-line 1.6 MB); `[app mobile app.js@N]` = the unobfuscated mobile build of the same SPA (the Cordova packaging `webapi-spec.md` was extracted from), used where the web bundle's API-manager/node layer sits in lazy chunks absent from its single-file decode. Static decode evidence, not wire-verified. |
| `[app mobile 2.41.0 vendors.js@<offset>]` | Byte-offset excerpt from the 2.41.0 mobile build's API-manager bundle (`assets/www/js/chunk-vendors.3ed6a158.js`), used for the htr_mod write bodies. Static decode evidence, not wire-verified. |
| `[app web tevolve@<offset>]` | Byte-offset excerpt from the decoded Tevolve SPA bundle (`https://tevolve.termoweb.net/js/app.0335ab61.js`, read 2026-10-20). Static decode evidence, not wire-verified. |

A claim with NO tag is a defect. Anything not in the map/code/diary is
either absent or explicitly `**[unverified]**`.

## 1. Conventions

### 1.1 Base URLs and endpoint families

- The API host the CURRENT vendor apps dial is `https://users-api.helki.com`:
  every decoded bundle (the brand web apps including Tevolve, the
  smartcontrol web app and mobile 2.40.4) is built against it, and only the
  1.417.1 mobile build still carries `api-lhz`
  `[app mobile 2.40.4 vendors.js@1561267]` `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.1]`.
  This integration dials it for every reseller key, live-verified with an
  `api-smartcontrol` account (grant + ws_user probe + reads, 2026-10-18);
  the reseller table's `api_url` is the BRAND KEY (Basic credential, serial
  id, `x-referer`, entry unique id), not a host.
- Tevolve is a separate tenant on that host: key `api-tevolve`, serial 15,
  web app `https://tevolve.termoweb.net/`. Its bundle embeds the same
  `VUE_APP_API_ENDPOINT` and its own Basic credential
  `[app web tevolve@1449750]`; a live login is still
  `**[unverified]**`.
- (Superseded, kept for the record:) the per-reseller hosts of the form
  `https://{api_url}.helki.com` are what the retired library dialed
  `[code session.py:216-223, reseller.py:19-101]`; several keys SHARED one
  host (`api-lhz`/`api-technoterm`/`api-smartcontrol` all mapped to
  `api-lhz.helki.com`).
- Several keys SHARE one host: `api-lhz`, `api-technoterm` and
  `api-smartcontrol` all map to `api-lhz.helki.com`; `api-valderoma` maps
  to `api-climastar`; `api-iheatcontrol` maps to `api-evconfort`
  `[code reseller.py:28-101]`.
- The token endpoint sits OUTSIDE `/api/v2`: `POST {host}/client/token`
  `[code session.py:357]` `[live 2026-10-04]`.
  [superseded: "`/api/v2/client/token`" -> that path 404s on the
  probed host (api-lhz, several reseller keys), password grant probed
  2026-10-04 `[live 2026-10-04]`; other hosts assumed
  `**[unverified]**`; the pre-2026-10-04 notes text said
  `/api/v2/client/token`.]
  Every endpoint listed in this file other than the token endpoint and
  the three host-relative families below IS under `/api/v2`.
- Host-relative (non-`/api/v2`) families the library dials directly:
  `/health_check` and `/version` (no auth) `[code session.py:330-343]`,
  `/api/notifications/v1/...` `[code session.py:1293-1321]`, and
  `/api/location/v1/coordinates` `[code session.py:1339-1355]`.

### 1.2 Reseller identity headers

- The token request carries `Authorization: Basic <reseller.basic_auth>`
  verbatim (still base64-encoded; decodes to `client_id:client_secret`,
  which the library never needs decoded) and
  `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
  `[code session.py:350-355]` `[doc webapi-spec.md §1]`.
- Every later request carries `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` and
  `x-serialid: <serial_id>`; JSON bodies set `Content-Type:
  application/json`. The retired library also sent `x-referer: <web_url>`
  where the reseller set one `[code session.py:242-249,
  reseller.py:17-26]`; the current mobile build does not, and this
  integration sends it only on the token grant
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §2]`.
- The Basic-auth credential is a reseller integration secret; capture
  via the web-app devtools or an HTTPS proxy (the capture recipe is not
  shipped) `[doc: pre-contract notes, Auth]`.
- Brand identity is per KEY, not per host: using the wrong key for your
  account yields `InvalidAuthError` even with valid user credentials
  (e.g. Lucht LHZ customers must use `api-lhz`, SmartControl customers
  must use `api-smartcontrol`) `[doc: pre-contract notes, Reseller keys]`
  `[code reseller.py:28-101]`. When diagnosing auth failures, check the
  reseller key first.

### 1.3 Units

- Temperature values travel as strings (`"20.0"`, `"19.5"`) and every
  temperature-bearing `/status` write carries `units` (`"C"` observed) —
  the app's 4-key profile-temp body includes it, and this integration
  refuses a unitless profile-temp body rather than posting one the app
  never sends `[doc webapi-spec.md §4 item 4]`; the app-shaped 4-key
  `/status` body is accepted and echoed live `[live 2026-10-20]`. The
  dedicated `/prog_temps` endpoint exists on the wire but this integration
  does not call it; it posts the app-shaped 4-key `/status` body
  `[writes.py:281-332]`.
- The app's UI step is 0.5 °C / 1 °F `[live 2026-09-28, user-verified]`
  `[app mobile app.js@473398]`.
- °F model (app-pinned): the °F grid is an INTEGER 1 °F grid
  (non-integer °F input is rejected client-side), the °F↔°C converters
  are fixed-point helpers that SNAP offsets to the 0.5 °C grid
  (1 °F ↔ 0.5 °C), and the wire `stemp` is always written in the node's
  own `setup.units` (an °F node receives e.g. `"69.0"` with
  `units: "F"`) `[app mobile app.js@506258, @2485204, @485218]`;
  server-side °F quantization remains `**[unverified]**` (§7).
- Off-grid setpoints are silently quantized to the 0.5 °C grid by the
  server (see §5) `[live 2026-09-28]`; the vendor app instead
  REJECTS off-grid input client-side (§5.2)
  `[app mobile app.js@506258]`.

### 1.4 Error hierarchy and HTTP mapping

Hierarchy `[code error.py:6-54]`:

- `SmartboxError` — base of every library error `[code error.py:6-7]`.
- `InvalidAuthError` — credentials/token rejected; triggers reauth
  flows `[code error.py:41-42]`.
- `APIUnavailableError` — transient trouble (also an
  `aiohttp.ClientConnectionError` subclass for consumer compatibility)
  `[code error.py:45-50]`.
- `SmartboxValidationError` — typed-mode payload drift; carries the
  wire `payload` attribute `[code error.py:23-38]`.
- `WsUserUnsupportedError` — the host does not serve `ws_user` (or the
  token is not a JWT); in the retired library callers fell back to
  socket_io, which this integration no longer ships `[code error.py:10-21]`.
- `ResellerNotExistError` — unknown `api_name` `[code error.py:53-54]`.

HTTP mapping, REST path (`_send_mapped`) `[code session.py:599-624]`:

| Condition | Raised as |
|---|---|
| HTTP 401 | `InvalidAuthError` `[code session.py:602-604]` |
| HTTP 5xx | `APIUnavailableError` (retryable on GETs) `[code session.py:603-609]` |
| Any other 4xx | `SmartboxError` `[code session.py:610-612]` |
| Connection error / truncated body / timeout | `APIUnavailableError` `[code session.py:613-621]` |
| 204, empty 200, or non-JSON 200 | returns `{}` `[code session.py:588-596]` |
| Undecodable JSON in a 2xx | `SmartboxError` `[code session.py:622-624]` |

HTTP mapping, token endpoint (`_authentication`) `[code session.py:399-438]`:

| Condition | Raised as |
|---|---|
| 429 | `APIUnavailableError` (rate limit is transient, never "bad credentials") `[code session.py:428-435]` — OLD-LIB mapping; the wire semantics of a token-endpoint 429 are `**[unverified]**`; This integration ALIGNED to this mapping (`TransportUnavailableError`, retried by the grant ladder, never the password fallback) `[2026-10-05, auth.py:310-317]` (§9) |
| Other 4xx (<500) | `InvalidAuthError` `[code session.py:436-437]` |
| 5xx | `APIUnavailableError` `[code session.py:438]` |
| Malformed 200 (wrong token shape / undecodable JSON / non-JSON body) | `SmartboxError` — a malformed success is NOT a credential rejection `[code session.py:388-397, 413-424]` |

GET retry policy: `_request_with_retry` retries `APIUnavailableError`
only, on GETs only, `max(1, attempts)` attempts (default 5), backoff
`backoff_factor · 2^attempt` (default factor 0.1), all sharing the call's
30 s budget (a backoff that would overrun it is skipped)
`[code session.py:626-657]`.

### 1.5 Timeout and deadline model

- Per-request timeouts (30 s total / 10 s connect) apply only to
  sessions the library created itself `[code session.py:52-53, 318-328]`.
- EVERY library call (refresh + retries + backoff included) is bounded
  by `_CALL_TIMEOUT = 30 s` regardless of whose websession is used;
  past the deadline the call fails with `APIUnavailableError`
  `[code session.py:55-58]`.

### 1.6 Response-mode contract

- `raw_response=True` is the constructor default: getters return the
  wire payload unvalidated, with only the documented list extraction;
  a payload too malformed to extract from raises `SmartboxError`
  `[code session.py:202, 727-730]`.
- `raw_response=False` returns a typed pydantic model; drift raises
  `SmartboxValidationError` carrying the wire `payload`
  `[code session.py:730-731, error.py:23-38]`.
- Model strictness is deliberate and asymmetric: status models are
  strict (drift is the signal); the TOP-LEVEL setup models
  (`DefaultNodeSetup`/`PmoSetup`) are `extra="allow"` because setup
  feeds destructive full-repost writes and unknown keys must survive
  `[code models.py:69, 93]`. CAVEAT: the nested
  `NodeFactoryOptions`/`NodeExtraOptions` sub-models use pydantic's
  default `ignore` `[code models.py:19-59]` — a typed read-and-repost
  would drop any FUTURE undeclared key nested inside
  `factory_options`/`extra_options` (the wipe hazard the doctrine
  warns against); the survive-the-roundtrip doctrine holds for the
  top-level setup models only.
- fw-1.9 status family: int `error_code`, extra `easy`/`runback`/`version`
  keys, no `act_duty`/`power_pcb_temp`; `DefaultNodeStatus` accepts both
  families (`error_code: str | int`, the latter two optional)
  `[live 2026-09-26]` `[code models.py:148-177]`.

### 1.7 Secret hygiene

- Query/body keys `token`, `pass`, `password`, `user_id` are masked in
  log output `[code session.py:65-71]`; URLs in errors and debug lines
  are redacted `[code session.py:79-88, 574-576]`; requests carrying
  sensitive params lose the aiohttp exception cause entirely (its
  `__str__` embeds the full URL) `[code session.py:533-557]`. The wifi
  password travels as a query param and is deliberately never logged
  `[code session.py:1323-1337]`.

### 1.8 Sync surface

`Session` (sync) contains zero wire logic: every method is a
`_run_and_close` delegation (`asyncio.run` + owned-session close) over
the async class, one event loop per call `[code session.py:1358-1395]`.
Legacy aliases `get_status`/`set_status`/`get_setup`/`set_setup`/
`get_prog`/`set_prog` map to the corresponding node endpoints (same
paths) `[code session.py:1436-1511]` — they are aliases, not separate
endpoints.

---

## 2. Auth & tokens

### 2.1 Grants

- Password grant: form body `{"grant_type": "password", "username": …,
  "password": …}` — the login email is passed AS `username`
  `[code session.py:474-480]` `[live 2026-10-04]`.
  [superseded: an `email`-keyed body -> rejected with 400 Bad Request
  (the JWT's `email` claim caused the confusion); live-probed
  2026-10-04 `[live 2026-10-04]`.]
- Refresh grant: `{"grant_type": "refresh_token", "refresh_token": …}`
  `[code session.py:456-461]` `[live 2026-10-04]`.
- Token response: `{access_token, refresh_token, expires_in, token_type}`
  `[code models.py:300-305]` `[live 2026-10-02]`. The library stores the
  newest pair on every grant `[code session.py:366-379]`.

### 2.2 Lifetime and rotation

- Access tokens are JWTs with a ~4 h TTL; claims
  `{clientId, email, exp, iat, iss, scope, serialId, userId}` — the
  `userId` claim addresses the per-user websocket (§4.1)
  `[live 2026-10-02]` `[code ws_user.py:109-133]`.
- The library refreshes when <60 s of lifetime remain
  (`_MIN_TOKEN_LIFETIME`) `[code session.py:49-51, 451-456]`; a response
  with `expires_in < 60` logs a warning and refreshes on the next
  operation `[code session.py:373-378]`.
- Each refresh grant ROTATES the refresh token and the OLD one remains
  valid (reuse verified with a >4 h-old token minting fresh pairs
  repeatedly) `[live 2026-10-02]`. The library keeps only the newest
  pair `[code session.py:366-379]`.
- Parallel password logins return the BYTE-IDENTICAL access token
  (deterministic re-issue); multiple concurrent sockets on the same
  token all work; no session invalidation exists — HA, web app and
  mobile app coexist by design `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Refresh-token server-side TTL was never captured (open, §7); the
  one-password-login fallback makes it irrelevant for availability
  `[live 2026-09-26]`.

### 2.3 Recovery doctrine

- Token refresh is serialized by `_refresh_lock` — the REST poller and
  socket loop must not race two refreshes with the same refresh token
  `[code session.py:236-239, 440-449]`.
- A rejected refresh (`InvalidAuthError`) clears the tokens and falls
  back to ONE password login before the error reaches the caller — a
  dead refresh token alone does not force a reauth flow
  `[code session.py:462-473]` `[doc: pre-contract notes, 2026-09-27]`.
- A 401 on any authenticated request invalidates the token, re-auths,
  and resends the request ONCE — the server acted on nothing, so writes
  are resent too `[code session.py:519-531]` `[doc: pre-contract notes,
  2026-09-27]`.
- A second concurrent 401 must not trigger a refresh storm:
  `_invalidate_access_token` is a no-op if the token was already
  replaced `[code session.py:482-491]`.

### 2.4 Credential-change behavior

- Changing the account password does NOT revoke outstanding tokens: an
  integration holding pre-change access + refresh tokens kept polling
  unaffected `[live 2026-09-26]`. Consistent with the code: steady-state
  auth never touches the password `[code session.py:440-470]`.
- A forced full re-auth with a stale password fails fast (immediate 401
  at `{host}/client/token`) and recovers cleanly once credentials are
  updated `[live 2026-09-26]`.

### 2.5 Socket-facing token facts

- The `ws_user` handshake validates `exp`: an expired token is rejected
  with HTTP 401; a fresh token per connect is LOAD-BEARING
  `[live 2026-10-02]` `[code ws_user.py:341-344, 364-370]`.
- Open sockets are cut by the server exactly at the token's `exp` with
  close code 1006 (§4.1) `[live 2026-10-02]`.

---

## 3. REST endpoints

`<type>` ∈ node types, `<addr>` int. Node types (C5 resolution): the
library enum is `htr, thm, htr_mod, acm, pmo`
`[code models.py:9-16]`; `pmo` and `htr_mod` exist in vendor fixtures
and app managers `[doc webapi-spec.md §3]`.
[superseded: "node type apparently can be htr, thm or acm (only htr
tested)" -> code enum + webapi-spec §3 add `htr_mod`/`pmo`; only
htr nodes are live-tested `[live 2026-09-26/27]`; thm/acm/htr_mod/pmo
node shapes are `**[unverified]**` on live hardware.]

### 3.1 Endpoint catalog

Response handling: "raw" = wire payload as-is (list extraction noted);
"typed" = validated model under `raw_response=False`. All refs are
`session.py` except E46 (old-lib method absent; documented and implemented here only). "WS side-effects" summarizes §5/§6 push behavior.

| # | Method & path | Body / params | Response handling | Live status | Ref |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E1 | `GET /health_check` | — | raw passthrough, no auth | never probed live `**[unverified]**` (shape) | `[code session.py:330-336]` |

| E4 | `GET /api/v2/devs` | — | raw wrapper `{devs, invited_to?}` for this client; the retired library flattened the optional `invited_to` into one list; typed `Devices` | wire shape `[live 2026-09-27]` | `[code session.py:733-746, models.py:255-259]` `[client.py:99-101]` |
| E5 | `GET /api/v2/grouped_devs` | — | raw: list of homes (`devs, extraData, id, name, owner`); typed `Homes` — typed mode DROPS wire `extraData` (no such field on `Home`) `[code models.py:262-269]` `[doc: pre-contract notes, 2.6.0 alignment round]` | wire shape `[live 2026-09-27]` | `[code session.py:748-755, 768-773]` |
| E6 | `GET /api/v2/groups/{home_id}/guest_users` | — | raw: `guest_users` list; typed `Guests` | never probed live `**[unverified]**` | `[code session.py:759-766, models.py:309-319]` |
| E7 | `GET /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/mgr/nodes` | — | raw: `response["nodes"]`; typed `Nodes` | entries keyed `type`/`addr` (+`name`,`installed`,`lost`), NO `node_type` key `[live 2026-10-04]` | `[code session.py:775-787, models.py:221-235]` |
| E8 | `GET /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/connected` | — | raw passthrough `{connected}`; typed `DeviceConnected` | `[live 2026-09-27/30]` | `[code session.py:790-798]` |
| E9 | `GET /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/mgr/away_status` | — | raw passthrough `{away, enabled, forced}`; typed `DeviceAwayStatus` | `[live 2026-09-27]` | `[code session.py:800-808, models.py:237-242]` |
| E10 | `POST /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/mgr/away_status` | `{away, enabled}`; `enabled` defaulted `true` client-side when omitted; the current 2.40.4 app also sends `forced: false` (the server overwrites it with `true`, §7 item 5) | None | writes verified `[live 2026-09-27]`; `{away}` alone also honored `[live 2026-09-27]`; app parity: both bundles send `{away, enabled}` with `enabled: true` defaulted, and the current app adds the server-owned `forced` key `[app mobile app.js@5156478, @17998851]` `[app helki.js@1231104]` | `[code session.py:810-827]` |
| E11 | `GET /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/mgr/discovery` | — | raw only | `{"discovery": "off"}` `[live 2026-09-27]` | `[code session.py:829-835]` |
| E12 | `POST /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/mgr/discovery` | pass-through, e.g. `{discovery: "on"\|"off", type?, addr?, limit?}` `[doc webapi-spec.md §2]` | None | `**[unverified]**` (never written live) | `[code session.py:837-851]` |
| E13 | `GET /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/mgr/rtc/time` | — | raw only | `{d,h,m,n,s,w,y}`, `n=8` in September `[live 2026-09-27]` | `[code session.py:853-855]` |
| E14 | `POST /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/name` | `{"name": …}` | None | `**[unverified]**` | `[code session.py:857-862]` |

| E16 | `POST /api/v2/devs/{dev_id}/group` | pass-through | None | `**[unverified]**` | `[code session.py:868-878]` |

Notes on catalog rows:

- E46 (`dev_data`) is NOT an old-lib `AsyncSmartboxSession` method — it
  exists in webapi-spec §2 and is implemented in this integration's protocol
  layer (`[client.py:119-121]`) for protocol-surface
  completeness; its `devData` nesting is the shape the ws `all_data`
  snapshot mirrors, which is what makes the row load-bearing.
- E4 flattening is load-bearing: raw mode merges the wire's optional
  `invited_to` list into one flat device list
  `[code session.py:737-745]`.
- E19 default window (C1 resolution): the shipped code sends
  `start=now-3600 … end=now+3600` — a **2-hour** window
  `[code session.py:936-941]`.
  [superseded: "defaults: a one-hour window centred on the call time"
  (pre-contract notes, samples section) -> the doc's one-hour wording is
  arithmetically wrong for the shipped ±1 h defaults; the method's own
  docstring repeats the stale wording
  `[code session.py:932]`.]
- E23's read is ALWAYS raw, independent of `raw_response`: reading
  through the `extra="allow"` model would still drop every undeclared
  key from the re-posted dump and wipe them on the device; the retired
  library shared one call budget across GET+POST
  `[code session.py:1018-1031]`. This integration bounds each client call
  separately, so a GET-merge-POST op can take up to two call budgets.
- E30's input guard: a body without a `prog` dict (or with the array
  shape) raises client-side `ValueError` before any traffic
  `[code session.py:1155-1169]`; the merge is day-level and the POST
  body is always `{"prog": merged}` `[code session.py:1170-1181]`.
- E10 client-side defaulting: the library adds `enabled: true` when the
  caller omits it, matching the vendor app `[code session.py:819-823]`
  `[live 2026-09-27]` — the app's UI layers pass only `{away}` and the
  defaulting happens one layer below, in both bundles; `forced` is
  never written by either client `[app mobile app.js@5156478,
  @17998851]` `[app helki.js@1231104, @620289]`.
  [superseded: pre-contract notes header "POST: TODO untested" -> writes
  live-verified 2026-09-27; the header line is stale.]
- E13 `n` field: `8` in September — 0-indexed or another meaning; the
  integration assumes month = `n + 1` (§7) `[live 2026-09-27]`.
- E33/E17 asymmetry (pmo `power` GET vs `power_limit` POST) is mirrored
  in code with a comment flagging it `[code session.py:884-889]`.

### 3.2 websocket side-effects of REST writes

- Every accepted node write pushes transient frames for the affected
  node; details, shapes and the per-endpoint confirmation bundle are in
  §5.3 `[live 2026-09-26/10-04]`.
- Away/discovery/prog/node-list frames also appear unsolicited (idle
  cadence, cold-boot burst) — §6 `[live 2026-10-02]`.

---

## 4. Websocket

Two transports are maintained in parallel by the vendor
`[live 2026-10-01/02]`. `socket_io` is NOT deprecated (mobile apps built
2025-08 still use it) `[live 2026-10-01]`; the web apps use `ws_user`
`[live 2026-10-01]`.

### 4.1 `ws_user` — the transport (per-user plain WebSocket)

- One connection serves every device of the account; per-device fan-out
  happens in the dispatchers `[code ws_user.py:1-19, 460-508]`.
- URL: `wss://{host}:443/api/v2/ws_user?token=<enc>&user_id=<id>`, with
  `user_id` extracted from the access token's JWT `userId` claim
  `[code ws_user.py:50, 138-151]`. A non-JWT token raises
  `WsUserUnsupportedError`; an empty token raises `SmartboxError`
  (caller error, retryable) `[code ws_user.py:109-133]`.
- Client→server frames: exactly ONE type, `{"event": "all_data"}`, sent
  on open and re-sent 1 s-debounced on every server
  `{"event": "should_sync"}` (debounce configurable, default 1.0 s)
  `[code ws_user.py:174-181, 388-389, 525-541]` `[live 2026-10-01/02]`.
  There is NO app-level ping in this protocol `[code ws_user.py:8-19]`
  `[live 2026-10-01]`.
- Server→client frames `[code ws_user.py:434-508]`:
  - `all_data` → `{"event": "all_data", "data": [homes]}` full snapshot
    (homes → devs → `devData`; ~8 kB for 1 home / 1 dev / 5 nodes);
    one `dev_data` callback per registered device
    `[live 2026-10-01]` `[code ws_user.py:460-479]`.
    Live `devData` shape (captured 2026-10-16): top-level keys
    `away_status`, `connected`, `discovery`, `geoData`, `geo_data`,
    `htr_system`, `nodes`, `pmo_system` — note the BARE `discovery`
    (the update path is `/mgr/discovery`) and the duplicate geo
    spellings; `nodes[]` entries carry `type`/`addr`/`installed`/
    `lost`/`name` plus `status`/`setup`/`prog`/`version` slots (the
    version slot exists in snapshots even though fw-1.9 pushes no
    version FRAME — §5.3); `htr_system` carries the box power limit in
    TWO copies, `power_limit.power_limit` as a digit string (the vendor
    web app's read) and `setup.power_limit` as an int, and the object
    copy comes through EMPTY when the limit is cleared
    `[live 2026-10-16, dedicated probe]`.
  - `update` → `{"event": "update", "devid": …, "data": {"path", "body"}}`
    — the path/body pair lives UNDER the `data` key
    `[live 2026-10-02, correcting an earlier flat recording]`
    `[code ws_user.py:481-508]`. Payload fields are identical to
    socket_io (`sync_status`, `stemp`, `mtemp`, `power`, …)
    `[live 2026-10-01]`. Handler path set covers `/mgr/away_status`,
    `/connected`, `/geo_data`, `/mgr/nodes`, `/htr_system/power_limit`,
    and node `status`/`prog`/`setup` `[live 2026-10-01/02]`.
  - `should_sync` → schedules a debounced `all_data` re-request
    `[code ws_user.py:454-456]`. Never observed live despite two outage
    variants (§7) `[live 2026-10-02]`.
  - Unknown events and malformed frames are logged and ignored; they
    never crash the receive loop `[code ws_user.py:436-459]`.
- Liveness:
  - The server/proxy sends a WebSocket PING every ~30 s; aiohttp's
    autoping answers (and swallows the PONGs)
    `[live 2026-10-01 tcpdump]` `[code ws_user.py:404-410]`.
  - Client heartbeat default 60 s (PONG window = half of it); this is
    the ONLY client-side dead-path detection — data silence of many
    minutes is NORMAL (max observed 789 s) and must never be treated as
    failure `[code ws_user.py:66, 190-196]` `[live 2026-10-01/02]`.
    This integration's transport adds a bound well clear of that cadence:
    zero frames for 45 min tears the socket down, so a wedged-but-alive
    socket still routes its outage through the ordinary close ->
    grace-window path `[ws_user.py:88-91]`.
  - The all_data reply is due right after the open (the server answers the
    client's own frame); a socket that delivers nothing within the connect
    window is a wedged session, not a quiet one. This integration tears it
    down and retries after 10 s (the vendor apps use base-delay + 5 s, 6 s
    on the first attempt) `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.1]` `[ws_user.py:81-85]`.
  - Handshake bounded by a 10 s timeout (aiohttp's `ClientWSTimeout`
    cannot bound a handshake; the library wraps it); teardown bounded
    5 s `[code ws_user.py:65-76]`.
- Token-expiry lifecycle: the socket is cut by the server EXACTLY at the
  token's `exp` — close code 1006 (abnormal: TCP dropped, no close
  frame, no HTTP error) → mandatory fresh-token reconnect every 4 h,
  ~4 s outage `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Reconnect doctrine `[code ws_user.py:54-87, 543-685]`:
  - Per cycle: 10 connect attempts, backoff `1.0 · 2^n` ±20 % jitter,
    cap 30 s; a served cycle → token refresh + go around (the steady
    state is one refresh per 4 h).
  - [superseded: vendor web-app reference "max 5 attempts or 30 s
    total" -> the library deliberately keeps trying longer (10
    attempts/loop); document as LIB policy, not vendor parity
    `[code ws_user.py:67]` `[live 2026-10-01 web-app decode]`.]
  - Vendor reference, now pinned to the app's exact constants: base
    delay `1 s · 2^n`, ONE-SIDED `+0–20 %` jitter (the app ADDS
    0–20 %, never subtracts — the lib's ±20 % is slightly wider),
    cap 30 s, budget `5 attempts OR 30 s total since the first
    failure` → permanent failure (`/lostConnection` redirect)
    `[app helki.js@1209876, @1199977]`. The mobile build instead uses
    socket_io defaults (cap 5 s, ±50 % jitter) and gives up after
    3 attempts `[app mobile app.js@17607196]`. The lib's 10-attempt
    loop remains a deliberate LIB divergence, now precisely scoped.
  - A successful cycle shorter than 30 s ("accept-then-kill") escalates
    the between-cycle pause via the same backoff
    `[code ws_user.py:79-82, 566-573]`.
  - Handshake 404/410 → `WsUserUnsupportedError` immediately
    `[code ws_user.py:54, 356-363]`.
  - Handshake 401/403 on a token the session trusts → token
    invalidation + FORCED refresh (retrying the same URL would no-op
    under clock skew) `[code ws_user.py:364-370, 576-578]`.
  - 3 consecutive fresh-token rejections → `WsUserUnsupportedError`
    (the retired library's supervisor fell back to socket_io; this
    integration re-probes in place and has no fallback, §4.2)
    `[code ws_user.py:85-87, 634-652]`.
  - Everything else (transport errors, 5xx, timeouts) is retried
    `[code ws_user.py:371-378]`.
- Capability probe `check_ws_user_support`: one-shot handshake on a
  FRESH token, 10 s timeout; 401/403/404/410 →
  `WsUserUnsupportedError`; anything else (5xx, 429, …) →
  `APIUnavailableError` (retryable, never "unsupported")
  `[code ws_user.py:720-760]`.
- Close-code 1006 ambiguity: 1006 surfaces BOTH for server cuts at
  `exp` and for locally-detected deaths (heartbeat); timestamps and
  context are the discriminator `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Idle push cadence varies between runs (steady ~44 s in one run,
  burst-then-silence in another) `[live 2026-10-01/02]`.

### 4.2 Transport policy (no fallback)

- `ws_user` is the ONLY transport this integration speaks; `socket_io` is
  retired (the vendor apps use `ws_user` too). There is no fallback to
  switch to and no fallback trigger to evaluate: a deterministic rejection
  (404/410 on the handshake, or three consecutive fresh-token 401/403s) is
  terminal, and setup surfaces it as unsupported
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.1]` `[ws_user.py:289-296, 355-378]`.
- The retired transport's facts and the old fallback doctrine stay on the
  record in Appendix A; nothing there is implemented or planned.

## 5. Write semantics

### 5.1 Key-count rule

- Multi-key status POSTs of MIXED categories are silently PARTIALLY
  applied: a restore POST `{"locked": false, "stemp": "20.0",
  "units": "C", "mode": "off"}` stored `locked` and `mode` but silently
  dropped `stemp` (no error, no clamp); the identical value POSTed alone
  was stored `[live 2026-09-26]`.
- Refined rule: multi-key bodies are accepted WITHIN a category —
  the vendor app ships them in production: `{stemp, units}`,
  `{mode, stemp, units}` (manual-with-temp and the `modified_auto`
  engage body), `{ice_temp, eco_temp, comf_temp, units}`
  `[doc webapi-spec.md §4]`, and the htr_mod setpoint
  `{on, mode, selected_temp, comfort_temp, eco_offset}`
  `[app mobile 2.41.0 vendors.js@5048320]`; the 3-key modified_auto body
  is confirmed live by a one-off A/B probe on this hardware, shape per
  webapi-spec §4 item 2 `[live 2026-09-28]`.
- Integration policy: one control key per POST (plus the `units`
  companion, which is not a control key), sequential writes — the safe
  pattern; do not change without a live A/B probe. The htr_mod setpoint
  is the deliberate exception because the vendor app itself sends that
  body. The library itself is a pass-through (None-filter only) and
  enforces NO key-count rule `[code session.py:977-991]`
  `[doc webapi-spec.md §4]`.
- Device-level exception: away writes are the app-shaped body
  `{away, enabled: true, forced: false}` (and `{away}` alone is honored)
  `[live 2026-09-27]` `[code session.py:810-827]`; the current app
  sends that shape, and the server overwrites `forced` with `true`
  `[live 2026-10-18]` `[app mobile app.js@5156478, @17998851]`
  `[app helki.js@1231104]`.

### 5.2 Value handling

- Off-grid setpoints are silently quantized DOWN to the 0.5 °C grid by
  the SERVER: `21.3→21.0`, `22.8→22.5`, `22.4→22.0` (floor, not
  round-to-nearest) `[live 2026-09-28]`. On an F node the server's grid
  is whole degrees and the BODY must keep the app's one decimal: a raw
  `{"stemp": "69.5", "units": "F"}` was stored/echoed as `"70.0"` (half
  up), while a whole-degree body WITHOUT the decimal (`"70"`) is rejected
  with a 400 `[live 2026-10-18, F-mode htr node]`. The three client postures
  differ: the VENDOR APP validates-and-REJECTS off-grid input
  client-side (°C: `temp % 0.5 !== 0` → error; °F: integer-only) and
  posts only `.toFixed(1)`-formatted values, never quantizing itself
  `[app mobile app.js@506258, @497729]`; the old lib does no
  client-side quantization and posts raw values (the server does the
  flooring) `[code session.py:977-991]`; this integration pre-quantizes
  client-side — Celsius floors onto the 0.5 grid, Fahrenheit rounds
  half-up to whole degrees (the app's integral F grid) (§9)
  `[values.py:108-125]`. Clients may quantize OR validate-reject — the
  vendor app rejects; acceptance of pre-quantized bodies is pending
  live confirmation (§9).
- Units on write (app-pinned): the wire `stemp` is ALWAYS in the
  node's own `setup.units` — the app converts the caller's value INTO
  the node's units before the POST (`getTargetTemp`), so an °F node
  receives e.g. `"69.0"` with `units: "F"` and grids are never mixed
  `[app mobile app.js@485218, @470073, @2485204]`.
- NOT every setup temperature field follows the node's unit: the
  `max_stemp_limit` CEILING is stored in Celsius regardless of the node's
  unit — the app converts it on read (`convertTempFromCelsiusToNodeUnits`)
  and on write (`convertTempFromNodeUnitsToCelsius`, decoded 2026-10-18),
  and its own settings screen showed 75.0 °F for the F node's stored
  `24.0` — while the `away_offset` follows the node's unit (3.0 °C-era ->
  5.0 on the F node) `[live 2026-10-18]` `[app mobile 2.40.4
  new_vendors.decoded.js]`. Consumers that read or write the ceiling must
  convert; reading it raw on an F node shows 24 instead of 75.
- The `"0.0"` sentinel: fw-1.9 setups carry `max_stemp_limit: "0.0"`
  from the factory `[live 2026-09-27]`; consumers treat `"0.0"` as
  "maximum-temperature limit disabled" and write it to disable
  (the integration's switch does exactly this). The write target is
  accepted and persisted: POSTing `"0.0"` produced a setup frame and a
  readback with `max_stemp_limit: "0.0"`, and restoring `"24.0"` did the
  same `[live 2026-10-20, htr fw 1.9]`. Enforcement is confirmed on the
  same node: with the ceiling at `"24.0"`, a `stemp: "24.5"` write was
  clamped to `"24.0"`; with the ceiling at `"0.0"`, the same `"24.5"`
  write was accepted and echoed `[live 2026-10-20]`. The sentinel
  therefore disables the server-side ceiling; write target, persistence
  and enforcement are all resolved.
- `modified_auto` is engaged ONLY by explicitly sending
  `mode: "modified_auto"`; it does not self-revert within the observed
  60 s window — reverting needs `{"mode": "auto"}`; a plain
  `{stemp, units}` write in auto leaves `mode: "auto"` on the wire yet
  still DRIVES the heater `[live 2026-09-28]`.
- Off-mode setpoints (case C): a setpoint write to an `off` heater is
  accepted (no error), a status frame is pushed, but the value does NOT
  stick — a delayed re-read minutes later still shows the old `stemp`;
  treat target-temperature writes while `off` as not-effectual
  `[live 2026-10-04]`.
- No-op (value-equal) writes produce NO websocket frames at all, even
  on live nodes; the transient lost→ok pattern only fires for
  value-changing writes `[live 2026-09-30]`.
- An immediate (0 s) follow-up write inside the post-write settle window
  DOES apply — no settle-window write drop for mode→stemp sequences on
  this family `[live 2026-09-28]`.

### 5.3 Confirmation frames

- Node status write: a full-body status echo frame arrives ~0.3–0.5 s
  after the POST on a live node (the ABSENCE of this frame is the only
  fast signal that a write did not land — §6) `[live 2026-09-26/30]`.
- Setup write (fw-1.9 node): a ~0.2 s burst of THREE frames —
  `/mgr/nodes` (full node-list re-push) + `/{type}/{addr}/status` +
  `/{type}/{addr}/setup` (the full merged setup body is the per-write
  confirmation); the immediate REST readback still lags (returned the
  pre-write value) `[live 2026-10-04]`.
  [superseded: "setup writes additionally push a full-setup body frame
  and a `/htr/<addr>/version` frame" (2026-09-26) -> NO `/version` frame
  was pushed for either watched setup write on fw-1.9; treat the
  version frame as absent/conditional on fw-1.9 and never rely on it
  `[live 2026-10-04]`.]
- Box power-limit write (`POST /htr_system/power_limit`): the server
  pushes BOTH `/htr_system/power_limit` (`{"power_limit": "<int as
  string>"}` — the value as posted, string form) and `/htr_system/setup`
  (the htr_system setup object: `{"power_limit": <int>,
  "refresh_period": 30, "extra_nrg_conf": {"enabled": true}}`, an INT)
  `[live 2026-10-16, one write 3600 -> 3000 with a socket listening]`.
  Snapshot copies stay in step across the write (`'3600'`/`3600` ->
  `'3000'`/`3000`); clearing the limit (unlimited) serves an EMPTY
  object copy with `setup.power_limit: 0` `[live 2026-10-16]`.
  Consequence for consumers merging frames into one slot: the two paths
  disagree on TYPE, so the value must be coerced to int
  (the old lib's `int()` does; this integration now does — §9).
  The "0" CLEAR is asymmetric on the push side: it delivered ONLY the
  `/htr_system/setup` frame (int `0`), with no `/htr_system/power_limit`
  frame at all `[live 2026-10-18]`, so a consumer that ignores the setup
  frame misses an externally-cleared limit — this integration routes its
  `power_limit` key into the same slot (§7 item 15).
- Prog write: one `/htr/<addr>/prog` frame arrives ~1 s after the POST
  carrying `{"sync_status": "ok", "prog": {"0": [...], ..., "6": [...]}}`
  — the WHOLE week, not just the changed day — and the immediate
  readback lags (the pre-write value) `[live 2026-10-18, one slot
  changed on an fw-1.9 htr node then restored]`.
- Node-list frame (`/mgr/nodes`): each entry is
  `{addr, type, name, installed, lost, uid, level, parent}`; the `lost`
  boolean is the untrustworthy one (§6.3) `[live 2026-10-18]`.
- Transient lost→ok sandwich (`/status {sync_status:"lost"}` then
  `/prog` lost then ok) was observed 2026-09-26 but did NOT reproduce in
  the 2026-09-30 session; treat it as defensive knowledge, not a
  guaranteed sequence `[live 2026-09-26/30]`.
- Device-wide node-list updates arrive as a frame whose body is
  `{"nodes": [...]}` with NO `path` `[live 2026-09-26]`; on ws_user the
  snapshot arrives inside `all_data` instead `[live 2026-10-01]`.

### 5.4 GET-merge-POST and settle lag

- `/setup` requires the WHOLE configuration to be re-posted; the
  library GETs, day-blind merges the caller's partial update, and POSTs
  the complete object (read always raw — §3.1 note) `[code
  session.py:1009-1031]`.
- `/prog` likewise: GET current, day-level merge, POST the complete
  day-keyed object; the ARRAY shape is rejected with 400
  `[code session.py:1140-1181]` `[live 2026-09-27]`.
- Settle-lag rule: a successful write is NOT immediately visible in GET
  — the server reads device state with a lag of several seconds (5 s
  verified sufficient); GET-verify flows that skip the sleep misreport
  writes as no-ops `[live 2026-09-27]`.
- Schedule drift caveat: heaters in `auto` change their own `stemp`
  (schedule setpoint transitions) between snapshot and verification —
  snapshot-diff restore checks must treat that as expected drift
  `[live 2026-09-26]`.

### 5.5 Boost and `extra_options` on boost-disabled units

- Factory boost-disabled units (no `boost_config` in `factory_options`):
  `POST /status {"boost": …}` is accepted without error but ignored
  (status keeps `boost: false`, both boost keys present and zero)
  `[live 2026-09-26]`. On boost-capable units the setup's
  `extra_options.version >= 2` switches `boost_temp`,
  `default_runback_temp`, `max_runback_temp` and `setback_temp` to
  Celsius; older nodes keep them in the node's display unit
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.3]`.
- `extra_options` setup writes are silently dropped on these units
  (partial and out-of-range objects both accepted, never stored, no
  error, no clamp); the replace-vs-merge question on boost-capable
  units remains open (§7) `[live 2026-09-26]`.

### 5.6 Writes to unreachable nodes / offline boxes

- Writes to unreachable nodes are silently accepted (~50–60 ms, HTTP
  OK, no device ack); only the absence of the confirming ok frame
  (~0.3–0.5 s on a live node) signals the drop `[live 2026-09-30]`.
- Writes to an offline BOX: the cloud attempts a live relay and does
  NOT queue — writes are applied-or-errored, never deferred; the
  vendor app first shows apparent success then errors within seconds;
  no residue is left `[live 2026-10-02]`.

---

## 6. Operational behavior

Dynamics only — nothing here contradicts §3–§5; where a number came
from a live round the date is the evidence pointer (§8).

### 6.1 Push latency and artifacts

- Every state change surfaces as a FULL-body status frame regardless of
  source (no deltas) `[live 2026-09-26/10-04]`.
- REST-driven changes echo on the socket in ~2 s; device-local changes
  (heater's own panel) relay in ~5–10 s `[live 2026-10-04]`. This does
  NOT contradict §5.3's ~0.3–0.5 s write-echo figure: the two
  measurements come from different rounds/transports (2026-09-26/30
  socket_io-era own-client POSTs vs the 2026-10-04 ws_user session
  driven by a third-party REST client) — treat write-echo latency as
  transport/context-dependent, not a single constant
  `[live 2026-09-26/30, 2026-10-04]`.
- `presence: true` fires when someone touches the panel (backlight) and
  a `presence: false` frame follows ~10 s later — panel-UI artifacts,
  not heating state `[live 2026-10-04]`.
- No server-side coalescing: distinct states arrive as distinct frames
  `[live 2026-10-04]`.
- Write echo frames arrive with full status bodies including the new
  value; unrelated auto heaters push their own frames plus a
  `/mgr/nodes` frame when their schedules tick `[live 2026-09-26]`.

### 6.2 Redundant frames

- Tolerate redundant state frames: a replug produces TWO `/connected`
  true events (22 s apart cold, 9 s warm) `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- The cold-boot burst carries `/mgr/nodes` ×5 (byte-identical; one copy
  per node-count — cause unknown) `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Duplicate `update` bodies for the same logical change can arrive from
  independent causes (the change itself vs separate measurement/UI
  deltas such as `mtemp` ticks) `[live 2026-10-04]`.

### 6.3 Node reachability (node power loss, box up)

- Device-level `/devs/{id}/connected` stays `true` — node loss is ONLY
  visible via node-level `sync_status: "lost"` on `/status` and
  `/setup`; there is no per-node connected endpoint `[live 2026-09-30]`.
- Offline node `/status` GET eventually returns a BARE
  `{"sync_status": "lost"}` (no mode/temps/power keys); `/setup` keeps
  the full field set with the lost marker; `mgr/nodes`' per-node `lost`
  boolean stayed `false` — do not trust it `[live 2026-09-30]`.
- Server-side flip latency: with zero traffic, last-known `ok` status
  served for 3.5+ min; bare-lost in place ~11 min later. Under a 7 s
  write cadence the first bare-lost push came ~67 s in, a second ~95 s
  after that (pushes DO reach connected sockets once the server
  concludes the node is lost). An IDLE node's flip IS pushed
  proactively: on a stable ws_user socket with zero traffic the server
  pushed the bare-lost frame (power cut → Unavailable, flip ~6m43s —
  one sample inside the ~4–11 min window, which is NOT a constant;
  recovery ~5 s on clean power-on) `[live 2026-10-03]` — evidence is
  the 2.6.0 soak TEST B (2026-10-03); this summary is the durable record.
- Vendor app flags a node unreachable ~5–6 s after an
  unconfirmed command — a client-side timeout, not an API answer
  `[live 2026-09-30]`.
- Recovery: a full fresh ok status frame arrives ~5 s after power-on
  with zero commands; boot frames first carry garbage (`error_code: 5`,
  `mtemp: -2764.8`, `duty: 106`, `ice_temp: "2.5"`) before settling
  within seconds — availability consumers should not render the garbage
  as real state `[live 2026-09-30]`.

### 6.4 Box outage cycle

- Mains-off: `/connected` flips false after 49 s; internet-only cut:
  44 s — detection is session-driven, indifferent to failure mode;
  the socket keeps pushing last-known data in the meantime, so
  `/connected` is the only offline signal `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Replug → `/connected` true in 6 s (mains) / 14 s (internet-only),
  plus a redundant second true `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Cold boot burst (box re-registering its devices): `/pmo_system`,
  `/htr_system/setup`, `/mgr/nodes` ×5, `/mgr/discovery`,
  `/mgr/away_status`, then per-node status + `/prog` frames
  `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Warm reconnect: NO burst; a physical node change made during the
  outage reached the server ~67 s after reconnect via the box's
  ORDINARY reporting cadence — divergence self-corrects silently
  `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- 424 Failed Dependency is the answer when the backend holds the box as
  NOT live and the read is box-local and ON-DEMAND: `/mgr/rtc/time`
  returned 424 on every drift-sensor poll (12x at a 5 min cadence,
  08:06-09:01 local) for the whole window in which `connected` was
  false (08:03:40-09:02:49) — the clock is read live from the box and
  the cloud will not serve a stale one `[live 2026-10-17]`.
- `connected: false` does NOT imply the box is down or its data stale:
  in that same window all five htr nodes kept reporting changing status
  (temperatures and `hvac_action`, including a heating-to-idle flip) and
  recovery showed NO re-sync burst, so the data path stayed up while the
  backend's liveness session for the box did not. Read the
  "`/connected` is the only offline signal" point above as "the only
  signal", never as "false means no fresh data" — a consumer that gates
  box-level availability on the flag would mark box entities unavailable for
  the whole window while node entities stay healthy (the pre-2.7 posture;
  this integration now keeps box controls usable through it and reports the
  flag as the connectivity sensor's STATE, `adapter.py:190-210`) `[live 2026-10-17, SmartControl 5xhtr fw 1.9
  plus its HA history export]`.

### 6.5 Client-side outage and liveness

- Client-side outages are INVISIBLE to the socket: `receive()` blocks
  on the half-open TCP connection, zero client-side errors (Wi-Fi down
  does not close TCP) `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Server-side close is UNKNOWABLE from an offline client (every close
  packet is lost; a lost RST is never retransmitted): "proxy alive and
  quiet" and "proxy closed, state dropped" are indistinguishable —
  treat every post-outage socket as DEAD until proven alive
  `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Writes double as liveness checks: a write/ping into a dead path fails
  fast (RST) or times out via retransmission `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Address change = permanent half-open: the socket stayed ESTABLISHED
  but a reliably-pushed state change never arrived `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- Client-initiated WS PINGs ARE answered; with `autoping=True` (default)
  aiohttp swallows the PONGs, so liveness tests must use the
  `heartbeat` parameter `[live 2026-10-02]` `[code ws_user.py:66,
  404-410]`.
- Heartbeat=60 verified end to end: dead-path detection ≤ ~60 s, 13
  retriable failures through a 2 min outage at the ~3.5 s backoff
  cadence (zero hangs, zero fatal exits), recovery 2 s after network
  return `[live 2026-10-02]`.
- socket_io's 85 s silence-abort cycle recurs every 3–7 min while a
  half-open TCP lingers; ws_user instead rides multi-minute silence and
  pays one ~4 s outage per 4 h token expiry `[live 2026-10-01/02]`.

---

### 6.6 Consumer frame rules

The rules this integration's store applies to pushed frames (the vendor
apps' routing table is `api-ws-user.md` §1.4):

- a frame is applied only when path and body are both truthy: an empty body
  neither replaces a stored slot nor counts as reachability evidence
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.4]`. A snapshot's empty slot body follows the same
  rule: `status: {}` / `setup: {}` is “no body yet”, not a value and not a
  reachability signal `[merging.py:165-176]`;
- frames update what the snapshot created: a frame for an unknown dev id is
  dropped (both apps do), and a slot frame for a node the node list does not
  hold is dropped, so a removed node cannot be resurrected by a late frame
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.3/§1.4]`;
- the box power-limit frame body is either an object carrying `power_limit`
  or the bare digit string; both forms land in the one numeric slot
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.4]`;
- a malformed frame is logged and dropped so the pump survives (the vendor
  apps close the socket and reconnect on a parse error — deliberate
  divergence: dropping keeps a single bad frame from costing a reconnect)
  `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.3]`.

---

## 7. Open questions

Answered questions stay here with their resolution and date for the
record; an item is open only while it has no resolution.

1. **RTC December indexing** — `mgr/rtc/time`'s `n` was `8` in
   September (0-indexed or other meaning); the integration assumes
   month = `n + 1`. Whether `n` wraps to 0 (0-indexed) or 12
   (1-indexed) in December is unknown — check live or capture a
   December frame `[live 2026-09-27/29]`. Vendor clients cannot
   adjudicate it: the mobile app's `getTime` exists but has ZERO
   callers, the response is never parsed, and the web bundle never
   touches `rtc` at all — the endpoint is app-ORPHANED, so the
   December check stays live-only `[app mobile app.js@18000389,
   @5162245]` (the current apps' endpoint inventory still lists it
   `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.2]`; no caller was found).
2. **°F grid ("F-grid")** — ANSWERED (live, 2026-10-18, one htr node
   switched to F): the vendor app's reading was right — °F is an INTEGER
   1 °F grid, the node's `setup.units` IS the scale (the F node serves
   `units: "F"` in status and setup), and the wire body must keep the
   app's one decimal: a whole-degree body WITHOUT it (`"70"`) is rejected
   with a 400, while `"69.0"` is accepted and echoed back. The SERVER
   quantizes a fractional F body to whole degrees half-up (raw `"69.5"`
   → `"70.0"`). This integration's `format_setpoint` quantizes °F to
   whole degrees (half up) and formats `.1f`, matching the server grid
   `[values.py:108-125]` `[live 2026-10-18]`
   `[app mobile app.js@506258, @2485204, @485218]`
   `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.4]`. The sub-question is ANSWERED too: the
   `max_stemp_limit` FIELD is Celsius regardless of the node's unit — the
   app's own vendor-app screenshot shows 75.0 °F for the F node's stored
   `24.0`, and the app's setting model converts both ways
   (`convertTempFromNodeUnitsToCelsius` on write, the reverse on read,
   decoded 2026-10-18), while the offset follows the node's unit (its
   3.0 °C-era value became 5.0 on the F node). The entity layer converts
   the limit for display and back on write `[values.py:80-108]`
   `[adapter.py:429-447]` `[writes.py:345-389]`; live write probe: 76.0 °F
   -> `"24.5"` on the wire, 75.0 °F -> `"24.0"` `[live 2026-10-18]`.
3. **`power_limit: 0` POST** — ANSWERED (2026-10-18): a CLIENT-posted
   `{"power_limit": "0"}` string body is accepted and behaves exactly like
   the app's own clearing flow — the readback serves `'0'`, the snapshot's
   object copy comes back EMPTY and `setup.power_limit: 0` — and the
   server pushes only the `/htr_system/setup` frame (int `0`) for it
   `[live 2026-10-18, live probe: 0 -> 4000 -> 0 on a live box, both
   directions read back through REST and the ws push]`
   `[live 2026-10-16, dedicated probe]`. Consumers treat
   `power_limit == 0` as "no limit" (user-confirmed semantics; web UI caps
   the editable range at 60000) `[app mobile app.js@18936187]`
   `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.3]`.
4. **pmo power-limit asymmetry** — ANSWERED and implemented: both endpoints
   are the vendor's own design — the current apps GET
   `/pmo/{addr}/power` (key `power`) for the reading and POST
   `/{type}/{addr}/power_limit` (stringified body, `0` = no limit) for the
   node's own limit `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.2/§2.3]`. This integration now
   exposes the node limit as a number + no-limit switch pair reading the
   setup's `power_limit` key (`writes.set_node_power_limit`, live-verified on
   the BOX endpoint only); the node-level acceptance of `"0"` and the
   endpoint's echo stay `**[unverified]**` (no pmo hardware in any live
   round) `[live 2026-09-27]` `[code session.py:884-902, 904-921]`.
5. **Away `enabled`/`forced` server-side meaning** — `enabled` is
   tolerated-but-not-required (RESOLVED 2026-09-27 for the write path);
   who may set `enabled`/`forced` and what `enabled: false` does to an
   away write remain unconfirmed; the current app hardcodes
   `enabled: true` / `forced: false` on every away write
   `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.3]`, so nothing in the apps exercises the
   other values. ANSWERED for `forced` (2026-10-18): the SERVER sets
   `forced: true` on an away write and the posted `false` does not stick
   (live: POSTed `{away: true, enabled: true, forced: false}` → the pushed
   `/mgr/away_status` frame carried `forced: true`, and the same on the
   away-off write; this also explains the unexplained false→true flip
   seen 2026-09-27/29 — no write had to carry it, the server derives it)
   `[live 2026-10-18]`. What `forced: true` MEANS remains unprobed.
6. **`should_sync` trigger** — never fired in two outage variants
   (mains cycle and internet-only cut); "box reconnect" and "warm
   server reconnect" hypotheses both rejected; trigger unknown. The
   debounce behavior is code-verified only — 1000 ms in both current
   apps too `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.2/§5]` `[live 2026-10-02]`
   `[code ws_user.py:525-541]`.
7. **htr_mod write semantics** — htr_mod nodes carry
   `on`/`selected_temp`/`comfort_temp`/`eco_offset` in status
   `[code models.py:180-186]`. The current mobile app's htr_mod manager
   sends `{on: true, mode: "manual", selected_temp, comfort_temp,
   eco_offset}` for a setpoint and `{on, mode, selected_temp}` for a
   profile, so the integration's mixed-category body is app-shaped
   `[app mobile 2.41.0 vendors.js@5035003, @5048320]`. Live acceptance
   on htr_mod hardware remains `**[unverified]**`; the apps route
   `htr_mod` status frames but exclude it from the version-frame regex
   `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.4]`.
8. **PMO cadence and samples** — the pmo sample shape
   `{t, counter, max, min}` differs from htr `{t, counter, temp}`
   `[code models.py:277-297]`, but pmo push cadence, `pmo_system`
   frames and power-limit behavior have no live observations (no pmo
   hardware in any live round); the current apps' inventory adds no
   cadence facts `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.2]` `**[unverified]**`.
9. **Refresh-token server-side TTL** — never captured; the rotation
   facts (§2.2) make it irrelevant for availability `[live 2026-09-26]`
   (rotation confirmed by the current apps
   `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.7]`).
10. **`extra_options` replace-vs-merge on boost-capable units** —
    unobservable on the boost-disabled family probed so far
    `[live 2026-09-26]`. The current apps drive such units through
    `/boost_mode` (2.40.4) and legacy `/boost`
    `[doc api-ws-user.md §2.3]`; the integration now follows the app's
    dispatch (1 fixed-time and 2 set-temp-and-time use the status/setup
    path; 3 FULL posts `/boost_mode`), with live acceptance still open
    for a full-boost unit.
11. **Backend-vs-physical divergence during rapid probing** — cause
    unknown; needs a `tools/live_probe.py ws` capture of a recurrence
    (setpoint off by 2–3° with the user at the heater; phantom
    `active=True duty=100` for minutes) `[live 2026-09-28]`.
12. **Idle lost-flip push** — RESOLVED 2026-10-03: the server pushes
    the bare-lost frame proactively to a connected ws_user socket even
    for an IDLE node (power cut → Unavailable, flip ~6m43s — a sample
    inside the ~4–11 min window, a window not a constant; recovery
    ~5 s) `[live 2026-10-03]`. Evidence: the 2.6.0 soak TEST B; this
    summary is the durable record.
13. **Per-host ws_user deployment** — ANSWERED at app level: the current
    apps are built against `users-api.helki.com` and ws_user is served
    there; this integration dials that shared host for every reseller key
    `[doc api-ws-user.md §1.1]` `[live 2026-10-18]`. Tenant deployments
    other than the probed one remain unproven on the wire.
14. **socket_io wire URL shape** — NOT PURSUED: the transport is retired
    for this integration and the vendor apps (Appendix A.1). The
    engineio-dialed URL was never pinned by packet capture; only the
    library-side construction is known `**[unverified]**`.
15. **`/htr_system/setup` frames** — DECIDED (2026-10-18): route the frame's
    `power_limit` key into the same numeric slot as `/htr_system/power_limit`
    (the evidence: the "0" clear pushes ONLY this frame, §5.3), ignoring the
    frame's other keys (`refresh_period`, `extra_nrg_conf` — unread); a
    keyless frame is a no-op. The old lib coerced it into the same slot too.
    Implemented in this integration's device-frame routing `[live 2026-10-18]`.
16. **`max_stemp_limit` sentinel and 4-key prog-temp body** — ANSWERED
    (2026-10-20, live, htr fw 1.9): POSTing
    `max_stemp_limit: "0.0"` was accepted, echoed in the pushed setup
    frame, and persisted in the REST readback; restoring `"24.0"` did the
    same. The app-shaped 4-key `/status` body
    `{ice_temp, eco_temp, comf_temp, units}` was accepted, echoed all
    three temperatures, and left `stemp`/`mode` unchanged; the original
    values were restored. The sentinel's enforcement was then tested on
    the same node: with the ceiling at `"24.0"`, `stemp: "24.5"` was
    clamped to `"24.0"`; with the ceiling at `"0.0"`, the same `"24.5"`
    was accepted and echoed. The dedicated `/prog_temps` endpoint itself
    remains unprobed `[live 2026-10-20]`.

## 8. Evidence appendix

One line per observation: date, what, where the detail came from. The raw
diary is not shipped; each line carries the durable claim.

- E1 (auth capture): web-app devtools / HTTPS-proxy recipes for the
  Basic credential, `x-serialid`, `x-referer` — the capture recipe is not
  shipped.
- E2 (2026-09-26, live, SmartControl account, 5×htr fw 1.9): payload
  family, boost-disabled semantics, `extra_options` probes, ws
  side-effects, T1–T3 + multi-key finding, echo frames —
  the pre-contract notes "Observed behaviour (2026-09-26)"; raw fixtures in
  `tests/fixtures/live/`.
- E3 (2026-09-26, live): password change does not revoke tokens;
  stale-password reauth fails fast — the pre-contract notes "Auth behaviour
  observations".
- E4 (2026-09-27, live): prog GET/POST shapes + 400-on-array +
  settle-lag rule; away `{away}`-alone honored; setup model widening;
  management-surface reads (discovery, rtc `n=8`, geo_data, extra_data
  404, presence config); error-mapping hardening; pmo asymmetry
  flagged — the pre-contract notes "2.6.0 alignment round".
- E5 (2026-09-28, live, one-off A/B probes): A/B setpoint-in-auto probe — stored
  AND driving; 0 s follow-up applies; `modified_auto` explicit-only,
  no self-revert ≤60 s; 0.5 °C floor quantization; OPEN backend
  divergence — the pre-contract notes "Setpoint-in-auto A/B probe".
- E6 (2026-09-29, integration round): open questions routed (RTC month,
  power_limit 0, away enabled/forced) — the pre-contract notes "Box-device
  round".
- E7 (2026-09-30, live): node-reachability probes — `/connected` stays
  true; bare-lost status; stale-ok ≥3.5 min / flip ~11 min; 67 s/95 s
  pushes under cadence; silent write acceptance (~50–60 ms); no-op
  writes push nothing; recovery ~5 s + garbage boot frames —
  the pre-contract notes "Node reachability".
- E8 (2026-10-01, live + app decodes): engineio 85 s abort math to the
  ms (HA log); ws_user protocol from the web app (6 s all_data
  watchdog); tcpdump proxy PING every 30.000 s; Android
  `com.technotherm.lhzapp` 1.417.1 (2025-08) on socket_io EIO=3 with
  the 20 s app ping — the pre-contract notes "Transports" + "Observation log".
- E9 (2026-10-01/02, live, dedicated probe): ws_user frames
  (single `all_data`, nested `update` payload, handler path set);
  idle cadence variability; 4 h idle run (133 updates, max gap
  448.9 s, zero closes); token lifecycle (JWT claims, exp-validated
  handshake, cut at exp with close 1006 ~4 s outage, rotating + reusable
  refresh tokens, byte-identical parallel logins); client-side outage
  invisibility + half-open model; heartbeat=60 full Wi-Fi-toggle cycle
  (13 retriable failures, recovery 2 s); reseller support matrix —
  the pre-contract notes "Transports" sections.
- E10 (2026-10-02, live, three outage variants): box outage cycle
  (49 s/44 s detection, double announce, cold-burst composition, warm
  reconnect silent self-correction ~67 s); offline-box write semantics
  (applied-or-errored, never queued); `should_sync` never fired —
  the pre-contract notes "Box outage + write semantics".
- E11 (2026-10-04, live probe round): token path + `username` field +
  `start`/`end` corrections; node-entry key shape; setup-write 3-frame
  burst with NO version frame; case C off-mode setpoint; push-latency
  and presence-artifact block — the parked edits in the pre-contract notes
  (left in place there; normative content absorbed here).
- E12 (2026-10-03, live, ws_user soak): idle-node power cut on a
  stable ws_user socket — server pushes the bare-lost frame
  proactively (flip ~6m43s, window not constant; recovery ~5 s) —
  from the 2.6.0 soak's own capture, which is not mirrored in the
  pre-contract notes; this summary is the record.
- E13 (2026-10-14, vendor-app review, read-only): third-implementation
  calibration against the decoded Helki SPA — calibration 3/3 passed
  (token POST `/client/token`, form-encoded `username` key; samples
  `start`/`end` epoch seconds; `x-serialid` on every call incl. the
  token POST, `x-referer` where set), then app-side pins: setpoint
  quantization is validate-and-reject (not pre-rounding),
  `power_limit` string body with `"0"` as the shipped unlimited, °F
  integer grid with offset-snapping converters and node-units writes,
  away `{away, enabled: true, forced: false}` (the server owns `forced`), and the
  exact ws_user reconnect constants — sources: the decoded web build
  (`app.helki.com.app.611c74a6`), the decoded mobile build,
  `webapi-spec.md`; no app-vs-`[live]` contradictions found. CAVEAT
  (lazy chunks): the web bundle's API-manager/node layer sits in lazy
  chunks absent from the single-file web decode — mobile-build excerpts
  fill those gaps, and every excerpt is flagged per source bundle; all
  excerpts were bounded-window extracted from the single-line bundles.
- E14 (2026-10-16, live, SmartControl account, 5×htr fw 1.9,
  `dedicated probe`): `devData` snapshot shape captured —
  top-level keys `away_status`/`connected`/`discovery`/`geoData`/
  `geo_data`/`htr_system`/`nodes`/`pmo_system`; `nodes[]` entries with
  `type`/`addr`/`installed`/`lost`/`name` + `status`/`setup`/`prog`/
  `version` slots and no per-node power key on the htr family; the box
  power limit in TWO copies (`power_limit.power_limit` digit string,
  `setup.power_limit` int) whose object copy EMPTIES when the limit is
  cleared; plus a controlled write (3600 -> 3000 from the vendor app
  with a socket listening) showing the server pushes BOTH
  `/htr_system/setup` (int) and `/htr_system/power_limit` (string).
  No `/mgr/nodes` frame in the 5 min window (idle cadence only). Closes
  E46's shape gap, adjudicates the §9 snapshot-read row, and largely
  answers §7 item 3; detail in §4.1 and §5.3.
- E15 (2026-10-20, live, SmartControl account, htr fw 1.9, `htr:3`):
  `max_stemp_limit` sentinel round-trip — `"0.0"` accepted, echoed in
  the pushed setup frame and REST readback, then `"24.0"` restored and
  echoed; and the 4-key `/status` prog-temp body — all three temperatures
  accepted/echoed, `stemp`/`mode` unchanged, originals restored. The
  sentinel's ceiling-enforcement semantics and the dedicated
  `/prog_temps` endpoint were not exercised. Detail in §5.2, §7 item 16.
- E16 (2026-10-20, live, SmartControl account, htr fw 1.9, `htr:3`):
  max-limit correction round-trip — lowering the ceiling from `"24.0"`
  to `"19.0"` pushed the corrected profile frame
  `{ice: "18.0", eco: "18.5", comf: "19.0", units: "C"}`, then the
  setup frame carried `"19.0"`; restoring `"24.0"` and the original
  `18.5/19.5/20.5` profiles was echoed cleanly. The status frame
  (`stemp: "20.0"`, mode `manual`) stayed unchanged.
- E17 (2026-10-20, live, SmartControl account, htr fw 1.9, `htr:3`):
  `max_stemp_limit` enforcement — with the ceiling at `"24.0"`, a
  `stemp: "24.5"` write was clamped and echoed `"24.0"`; with the
  ceiling at `"0.0"`, the same `"24.5"` write was accepted and echoed
  `"24.5"`. Setpoint and limit were then restored (`20.0` / `"24.0"`);
  `active` stayed false and `duty` 0 throughout.

## 9. Known implementation divergences

Cases where the two implementations of this wire contract disagree:
the old lib and this integration's protocol layer
(`custom_components/smartbox/smartbox_protocol/`). Code citations use the
`[file:line]` tag. Rows marked code-TBD need a fix
IN THE CODE (or a probe to adjudicate); this file records, it does
not adjudicate.

| Wire question | Old lib | This integration | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Token-endpoint 429 semantics | `APIUnavailableError` — rate limit treated as transient and retried `[code session.py:428-435]` | 429 → `TransportUnavailableError` (transient: retried by the grant ladder, never triggers the refresh->password fallback — a password re-grant while rate-limited would amplify the limit); other 4xx → `AuthError` `[auth.py:293-303]` `[2026-10-05]` | wire semantics `**[unverified]**`; resolved-deliberate — 429 reclassified transient `[2026-10-05]` |
| `power_limit` POST body shape | stringified `{"power_limit": "<int as string>"}` `[code session.py:913]` | stringified `{"power_limit": str(value)}` at BOTH endpoints — the box `htr_system` one `[writes.py:445-464]` and the node's own `/{type}/{addr}/power_limit` `[writes.py:466-487]` — lib, app and this integration now agree `[2026-10-05]`; GET side unchanged (raw passthrough) | resolved-deliberate (lib and app agree on the string form — `powerLimit.toFixed(0)`, both the htr_system and node/PMO endpoints `[app mobile app.js@5159281, @5159154]`; the box `"0"` clear is live-verified 2026-10-18; node-level `"0"` remains `**[unverified]**` — no pmo hardware) |
| Non-JWT / empty token classification | non-JWT → `WsUserUnsupportedError` (terminal unsupported → socket_io fallback); empty token → `SmartboxError` `[code ws_user.py:109-133]` | both → `AuthError` from `jwt_user_id` — unusable credentials, terminal for the supervise ladder (no restart loop) and recovered through the reauth flow; messages stay token-free `[jwt.py:54-71]` `[2026-10-05]` | resolved (classification is deliberate: a token the client cannot decode is a credential problem, not a capability one) |
| 2xx with an undecodable JSON body | `SmartboxError` `[code session.py:622-624]` | 204 / empty / non-JSON content-type → `{}` (unchanged); a JSON content-type with an undecodable body → `SmartboxError`, message bounded to status/content-type/length — never the body `[client.py:352-375]` `[2026-10-05]` | resolved |
| ws_user reconnect attempts | 10 connect attempts/loop `[code ws_user.py:67]` | 10 attempts/loop — matches; jitter ALIGNED to the vendor's one-sided `+0–20 %` form: `uniform(1.0, 1.2)`, cap 30 s unchanged `[ws_user.py:548-557]` `[2026-10-05]` | resolved (deliberate LIB policy; the vendor web-app reference says 5 attempts / 30 s total with ONE-SIDED `+0–20 %` jitter `[app helki.js@1209876]` — §4.1; the ± vs + nuance is no longer a divergence `[2026-10-05]`) |
| Off-grid setpoint quantization | posts the raw value (no client quantization) `[code session.py:977-991]`; the server floors whatever reaches it `[live 2026-09-28]` | pre-quantizes client-side before POST: Celsius floors onto the 0.5 grid, Fahrenheit rounds half-up to whole degrees in the app's `.1f` body form (the server 400s a decimal-less F body, live 2026-10-18) `[values.py:108-125]` `[live 2026-10-18]` | four postures on one wire: the vendor app validates-and-REJECTS off-grid input client-side (C: `temp % 0.5 !== 0`; F: integer-only) and posts only `.toFixed(1)` values `[app mobile app.js@506258, @497729]` / the server FLOORS `[live 2026-09-28]` / the lib posts raw / this integration pre-quantizes — floor matches the verified server behavior on C; on F the whole-degree `.1f` body is accepted and the server's own fractional-input quantization is half-up (live 2026-10-18) — `**[unverified]**` |
| GET retry constants | 5 attempts, backoff factor 0.1 `[code session.py:626-657]` | 3 attempts, factor 1.0 `[client.py:47-49, 219-244]` | resolved (client policy; the wire semantics — GET-only retry, shared 30 s budget, skipped overrunning backoff — match) |
| Away write body | 2-key `{away, enabled}` with client-side `enabled: true` defaulting `[code session.py:810-827]` | the app's 3-key body `{away, enabled: true, forced: false}` `[writes.py:426-443]` | resolved-deliberate (adopted the app shape; the server sets `forced: true` regardless `[live 2026-10-18]`) |
| `get_power_limit` return form | `int(resp["power_limit"])` | raw payload passthrough `[client.py:203-205]` | resolved (client-side extraction; the E17/E33 pmo asymmetry is flagged in both) |
| Snapshot power-limit read and frame-slot type | jq dev_data `.htr_system.setup.power_limit`, frames `.body.power_limit`, both wrapped in `int()` `[code update_manager.py:368-380, session.py:880-921]` | read flat `htr_system["power_limit"]` — the OBJECT, not the value — and stored frame bodies uncoerced, so a digit-string body landed in the int slot (engine.py before 2026-10-16) | ADJUDICATED 2026-10-16 and FIXED: the live snapshot carries both copies (`power_limit.power_limit` digit string, `setup.power_limit` int), the server keeps them in step on a write, clearing the limit serves an EMPTY object copy with `setup.power_limit: 0`, and the write pushes both paths with different TYPES — this integration now reads the object first with the `setup` fallback (`_snapshot_power_limit`) and coerces every path to int (`coerce_power_limit`) `[merging.py:110-158]`; the old lib's `setup` read is current on this family and its `int()` already absorbs the string frame body |
| `max_stemp_limit` unit | raw pass-through: the value was treated as the node's unit and remembered/converted in that scale `[code session.py 2.6.x models.py:552-559, 736-744]` | converts both ways around the wire's Celsius: reads convert into the node's unit for the entities, writes convert back and snap to the 0.5 °C grid `[values.py:80-108]` `[adapter.py:429-447]` `[writes.py:345-389]` | resolved-deliberate (app-decoded: the vendor app converts this field both ways and displays 75.0 °F for a stored 24.0; live probe 76.0 °F -> `"24.5"` `[live 2026-10-18]`) |

### App-vs-integration checks

These are UI/behaviour differences around the same wire, not different
endpoints or bodies:

- **`max_stemp_limit` re-enable value.** The app's
  `MAX_STEMP_LIMIT_ENABLED` path writes the global maximum when enabling
  and `"0.0"` when disabling
  `[app mobile 2.41.0 vendors.js@2843163]`. This integration writes
  `"0.0"` to disable and restores the **last non-zero limit** on enable
  (`switch.py` max-temperature switch; documented in README). The wire
  body is app-shaped; the enable value is a deliberate UX choice.
- **Programme-temperature sanitization.** The app clamps each changed
  profile temperature to its per-profile limits, enforces the
  ice/eco/comfort ordering with the profile offset, and after lowering
  `max_stemp_limit` posts corrected profile temperatures when one exceeds
  the new ceiling
  `[app mobile 2.41.0 vendors.js@2845899, @2853563, @2854733]`. The
  integration now performs the same clamp in
  `merging.sanitize_prog_temps` (with the changed profile exempt from the
  neighbour pass) and `engine.set_max_stemp_limit` posts the corrected
  4-key status body when a profile sits above the new ceiling; the
  correction was live-verified 2026-10-20. The
  low-level `WriteApi.set_prog_temps` remains a transport primitive and
  does not sanitize by itself.
- **4-key body on the protocol API.** The app's UI path posts all three
  temperatures plus `units` to `/status` (`applyProgTemps`). The
  integration's HA callers also pass all three, so the live body matches;
  the low-level `WriteApi.set_prog_temps` still permits omitting a key
  (`None`), which the app's UI path does not.

## Appendix A — retired: `socket_io` and the old lib's dispatch

Kept for the record. `socket_io` is the legacy per-device transport: the
vendor apps no longer use it, and this integration dropped it in the
three-layer rewrite. The dispatch notes describe the old library's
machinery. Nothing below is implemented or planned; the `[code ...]`
citations name the `smartbox` library's source, kept
as the origin of these facts.

### A.1 `socket_io` — the retired per-device transport

- URL/namespace (C2 resolution): the engineio client dials
  `{api_host}/?token=<enc>&dev_id={dev_id}` — token and dev_id go on
  the BASE URL query; `/api/v2/socket_io` is the socket.io NAMESPACE
  (a routing name), NOT an HTTP path
  `[code socket.py:20, 376-378]`.
  [superseded: pre-contract notes transports table
  "`wss://<host>:443/api/v2/socket_io?token=…&dev_id=…`" -> conflates
  namespace with URL path; the dialed URL is the base host plus query.]
  The exact engineio wire URL (with EIO query params the client appends)
  should be pinned by a packet capture before quoting it externally
  `**[unverified]**` (only the library-side URL construction is
  code-pinned).
- Protocol: socket.io over engine.io — EIO=4 from Python, EIO=3 from
  the mobile app; the endpoint accepts both `[live 2026-10-01]`.
- Per-device session; transport `["websocket"]` only
  `[code socket.py:224-232]`.
- `dev_data` emit: sent right after a successful connect; PLUS a
  fallback emit inside `on_update` when no server message has arrived
  yet (the emit races the server drop — that race is why the gate
  exists); `update` frames are ignored until the first `dev_data` is
  received `[code socket.py:85-98, 197-203, 276-286]`.
  [superseded: "On successful connection, the client should emit a
  dev_data event" (pre-contract notes) -> code also re-emits on the first update
  if nothing was received `[code socket.py:88-97]`.]
- Keepalive: app-level `"ping"` string every 20 s (skipped while
  disconnected); NEVER answered by the server `[code socket.py:205-223]`
  `[live 2026-10-01]`. It is a faithful copy of the vendor mobile
  client's behavior, not a lib invention `[live 2026-10-01]`.
- Failure mode on server silence: the engineio read loop aborts after
  exactly `pingInterval + pingTimeout` (25 + 60 = 85 s) — engineio
  behavior, not a library constant — and recurs every 3–7 min while a
  half-open TCP connection lingers `[live 2026-10-01]`.
- Reconnect: 10 attempts, backoff `1.0 · 2^n` cap 30 s → fall through
  to the REST token refresh (itself retried with capped backoff; only
  `InvalidAuthError` ends the loop); exit flag checked BEFORE the REST
  refresh `[code socket.py:23-30, 360-429, 431-443]`.
- Teardown: bounded (5 s) single idempotent disconnect shared by
  cancel/shutdown; SIGINT handler install/remove; dangling cleanup
  tasks awaited (bounded) `[code socket.py:26-30, 310-345, 472-505]`.
  [superseded: the five teardown defects recorded 2026-09-26 (hang,
  double disconnect, REST detour, dangling tasks, log misuse) -> all
  fixed in code `[code socket.py:26-30, 310-345, 472-505]`; see
  pre-contract notes "E2 round — lib-side teardown residuals" (closure
  recorded in its 2.6.0 alignment round) — NOT §8/E2, which is the
  same-date live payload round.]
- The engineio client is bound to the REST session's websession
  (`external_http=True`) — disconnect never closes the shared session
  `[code socket.py:184-195]`.

### A.2 The retired fallback doctrine

- ONLY deterministic handshake rejections signal "endpoint unsupported":
  the probe maps 401/403/404/410 on a fresh token; the run loop retries
  everything except 404/410 (mid-run 401/403 also mean
  expired-but-refreshable) `[code ws_user.py:54-57, 720-760]`.
- Transient transport errors are retried and NEVER treated as
  unsupported `[code error.py:10-21]`.
- Per-host ws_user deployment is verified only for api-lhz; a released
  consumer must probe, not assume (§7) `[live 2026-10-02]`.

### A.3 The old lib's update dispatch (`UpdateManager`)

- Subscriptions: `dev_data` jq subscriptions (fast path for
  single-level keys); `update` subscriptions = path regex + body jq,
  regex named groups passed as kwargs; user callbacks are
  exception-isolated `[code update_manager.py:46-165]`.
- Node-key subscriptions pair the dev_data jq
  `(.nodes[] | {addr, type, <key>})?` with the update regex
  `^/(?P<node_type>[^/]+)/(?P<addr>\d+)/<key>$` for
  status/setup/version/prog `[code update_manager.py:366-431]`.
- Node availability: ok status/setup frame → Available (cancels
  timers); `sync_status: "lost"` → 6 s grace timer
  (`unavailable_delay`, default 6.0) → Unavailable; unknown
  `sync_status` values change nothing `[code update_manager.py:28-33,
  532-560, 602-613]` `[live 2026-09-30 shapes]`.
- Write confirmation `expect_write_confirmation(node, written, kind)`:
  6 s window (`write_confirm_timeout`, default 6.0), then one-shot
  discriminating GET (status or setup; unknown `kind` → `ValueError`);
  a bare-lost payload in typed mode fails validation and the carried
  `payload` IS the Unavailable verdict; `_written_applied` tolerates
  numeric-string precision differences (1e-6) and treats an explicit
  `sync_status: "lost"` payload as never-applied
  `[code update_manager.py:28-33, 459-521, 615-697, 740-773]`.
- ws_user mode: the manager registers its device on a shared
  `WsUserSocketSession` and `run()` parks until `cancel()`; the shared
  socket's run loop is owned by the caller `[code update_manager.py:168-273]`.
