# Project status

> completed work lives in git. Release history and CI status live in
> `CHANGELOG.md`, tags/releases and GitHub Actions; they do not belong here.

## State of 3.1.0

- Library `3.0.0` and integration `3.1.0` are the current stable releases.
  `main` is fast-forwarded to the 3.1 split line, and the library `main` is
  fast-forwarded to `3.0`.
- The library split, native temperature properties, logger metadata, heater
  to box device linking, bundled program card and Sunday-first schedule fix
  are shipped.
- The stable install check on HAOS and the GitHub release publication remain
  the final verification steps.

## Post-release watch

- Watch issue reports from fork users and the upstream thread.
- Stale-device cleanup (unchanged since 3.1.0-rc.3): the unpair, power-cut and
  re-pair checks are the only release-adjacent live checks not recorded
  here. Record the results when they are exercised.
- Token reconnect: the rc series showed the expected quiet cut every 4 hours.
  Revisit only if a cut lasts far longer than ~4 s or happens more often
  than every 4 h.
- Write confirmation: the 6 s countdown starts when the POST returns; the
  in-flight hold covers a token refresh or a slow request. Revisit if writes
  to a box still look slow.
- Public forum announcement remains on hold.

## Open items (hardware-gated)

`docs/api-contract.md` §7 is canonical for the wire questions and their
statuses; the max-limit `"0.0"` and 4-key prog-temp probes live in
`docs/api-contract.md` §5.2 and E28. The ones that need the maintainer's
hardware — or a season:

- `window_open` retry, cold night only: open the window AND door BEFORE
  starting heat, setpoint 23 °C, outside below 5 °C; success is
  `window_open: true` in the frame plus the heater self-pausing (active
  false, duty 0) while the temperature keeps falling.
- RTC `n` month indexing — waits for December (the endpoint is
  app-orphaned; live only).
- `htr_mod` preset/comfort writes — the 2.41.0 app sends the mixed-category
  body (`on`+`mode`+`selected_temp`+`comfort_temp`+`eco_offset`), so the
  shape is app-evidenced; live acceptance still needs an htr_mod unit.
- PMO cadence, `pmo_system` frames and power-limit behavior — needs a pmo
  unit.
- Boost write path: the app's dispatch is implemented from the 2.41.0
  bundle — `boost_config` 1/2 use status/setup, 3 (FULL) posts
  `/boost_mode {active, mode, temp?, time?}`. Live acceptance on a
  full-boost unit remains open.
- Full-boost UI: Runback/Advanced-boost presets are gated by
  `boost_modes_available`; the number entities remain defaults, the
  climate target is the active temperature, and `boost_mode`/
  `boost_end_time`/`boost_remaining_minutes` are attributes.
  `smartbox.set_boost_mode` covers active duration and explicit modes.
- Live 2026-10-20 (htr fw 1.9): `max_stemp_limit "0.0"` write accepted
  and persisted (restored `"24.0"`), and the app-shaped 4-key
  `/status` prog-temp body accepted and echoed (originals restored).
  The sentinel's enforcement is confirmed: with the ceiling at `"24.0"`,
  `stemp 24.5` clamped to `"24.0"`; with `"0.0"`, the same setpoint was
  accepted and echoed. The dedicated `/prog_temps` endpoint is dormant:
  the vendor apps still use the 4-key `/status` body, so revisit it only
  if a future Android app release calls the endpoint.
- Programme-temperature writes now apply the app's per-profile clamp,
  ice/eco/comfort offset, and post-limit correction; the max-limit
  switch still deliberately restores the last remembered limit rather
  than the app's global maximum. Live 2026-10-20: lowering the ceiling
  from 24 to 19 pushed the corrected `18.0/18.5/19.0` status frame;
  both values were restored.
- Statistics completion is recorded when the rows are queued to the
  recorder, not when the recorder commits them. A recorder job dropped
  after queueing would leave that node marked imported; revisit only if
  recorder failures are observed.
- Tevolve tenant (`api-tevolve`, serial 15) is selectable. Its constants
  came from the vendor web bundle; a live login is still unverified.
- Quality-scale brands submission (logo assets and the
  `home-assistant/brands` entry) is postponed; the manifest keeps
  `"quality_scale": "custom"` until it lands.

Record results in `docs/api-contract.md` §7 as they are worked.

## Pending decisions

- Release target: the fork `jandado/hass-smartbox` is the target for the
  3.x line. `manifest.json`, `pyproject.toml`, the README badges and
  `const.GITHUB_ISSUES_URL` point there; upstream authorship and codeowner
  credit are preserved. Revisit if upstream adopts the rewrite or the fork
  becomes a separate project.
- Minimum Home Assistant: 2026.5.0 is the supported floor; `tox -e min`
  (CI job `minimum-home-assistant`) pins the harness that exercises it.
- Marketplace/HACS metadata: the 2026.11 release replaces HACS with
  Marketplace. The repository metadata and HACS Action are unchanged at the
  2026.5 baseline; revisit when 2026.11 becomes the minimum.
