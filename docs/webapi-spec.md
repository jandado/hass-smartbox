# Web API spec — as used by the vendor app (Helki platform)

**Provenance:** statically extracted from the official Android app
`com.technotherm.lhzapp` v1.420.1 (APK sha256 `43df21cf…d4df1`),
`assets/www/app.js` — the Cordova packaging of the same "Helki" Vue SPA that
powers `app.smart-control.eu` (plus native BLE/ESP-Touch provisioning
bridges). Cross-checked against live wire probes (see `api-contract.md`)
("Observed behaviour") and against this library's `session.py` surface.

**Status markers:** ✔ = matches the retired library's behaviour at the
time of extraction; ⚠ = discrepancy or unverified-on-our-hardware item
(each has an entry in §Discrepancies). These markers are historical: the
3.0 integration's implemented surface is `api-contract.md` §3.1/§9, and a ✔
here does not mean the 3.0 client calls that endpoint. Everything here is
cloud-API over HTTPS — the current builds dial
`https://users-api.helki.com` (`api-contract.md` §1.1 has the host
history); the local-LAN API of the box is documented at the end (§Local
API, informational).

## 1. Auth ✔

- `POST /client/token`, headers `Authorization: Basic <client_basic_auth>`,
  `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, body form-encoded:
  - sign-in: `grant_type=password`, `username`, `password`
  - refresh: `grant_type=refresh_token`, `refresh_token`
- Response: `{access_token, refresh_token, expires_in}` → all later calls
  `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.
- Brand headers on every call: `x-serialid: <reseller serial id>`, and
  `x-referer: <scheme+host of frontend>` where set (matches
  `smartbox/reseller.py`). Library implementation ✔ identical.

| `GET/POST /api/v2/devs/<dev_id>/mgr/away_status` | **✔ payload verified live (2026-09-27)**: app sends `{away: bool, enabled: bool}` (enabled defaults true in app code); server honours both `{away, enabled}` and `{away}` alone — library defaults `enabled: true` since 2.6.0 |
| `GET /api/v2/devs/<dev_id>/mgr/discovery` → `{discovery: 'on'|'off'}` ✔ (verified live) |

| `GET /api/location/v1/coordinates?country=&state=&city=&zip=` | geocoding helper |

## 3. Node level (`<type>` ∈ htr, htr_mod, thm, acm, pmo; `<addr>` int)

| Method & path | Body / notes |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/v2/devs/<dev_id>/<type>/<addr>` | full node data ✔ (library uses per-section GETs instead — equivalent) |
| `GET .../status` ✔ | |
| `POST .../status` | **write semantics — see §4** ✔ shape-compatible |
| `GET .../setup` ✔ | |
| `POST .../setup` | **full merged setup object** — library already merges before POST ✔ (session.py `set_node_setup`) |
| `GET .../version` ✔ | |
| `GET .../prog` | **schedule read** — returns `{prog: {…}}`; per the app, `prog.prog` = 7 day-arrays of ints (profile indices) — ✔ captured live 2026-09-27: string day keys `"0".."6"`, 24 hourly slots at prog_resolution 0 |
| `POST .../prog` | **schedule write** — body `{prog: …}` — ✔ implemented in 2.6.0 (`set_node_prog`); day-keyed object shape; the JSON-array shape is rejected with 400 (observed live) |
| `POST .../prog_temps` | dedicated prog-temperature endpoint (in `APIManager`; app's manager actually uses `POST .../status` with `{ice_temp, eco_temp, comf_temp, units}` — see §4; no caller found for plain htr) |
| `POST .../mode` | dedicated mode endpoint (in `APIManager`; node managers use `POST .../status {mode…}` — see §4) |
| `POST .../lock` | dedicated lock endpoint (managers use `POST .../status {locked}` ✔) |
| `POST .../boost` | boost config `{active, temperature, units, time}` — boost-capable products only; **our 5× htr are factory boost-disabled (N/A)** |
| `POST .../power_limit` | `{power_limit: "<int>"}` (node-level, PMO) |
| `POST .../name` `{name}` / `POST .../select` `{select}` / `GET .../power` / `DELETE .../<type>/<addr>` (`{purge}`) | fleet-management ops — ✔ implemented in 2.6.0 (unverified live) |

### 3.1 Charge level field by model code

The web app's `getChargeLevel` derives the model code from the node version's
`pid` and picks the status field by it:

```js
switch (((data.version || {}).pid || "").toUpperCase().slice(2, 4)) {
  case "1C":
    return data.status.current_charge_per;
  default:
    return data.status.charge_level;
}
```

The slice is positional: characters 3–4 (indices 2–3) of the PID, so the
four-character PID `081c` yields `1C`. Shorter PIDs yield the default branch.
Provenance: decoded web-app helper; the snippet and the storage-heater case
(`081c`) were reported against the upstream integration in PR #45
(2025-12-07). The version endpoint carrying `pid` is recorded in
`api-contract.md` §3.1 E24.

## 4. Status write semantics (as exercised by the app)

(The current apps' write surface — endpoints and bodies — is
`api-ws-user.md` §2.3; this section keeps the decoded web app's view.)

App-side node managers build these bodies (all to `POST .../status`):

1. Setpoint: `{stemp: "20.0", units: "C"}` — ✔ identical to integration.
2. Setpoint in auto: same body; app *optionally* adds `"mode": "modified_auto"`
   (auto→temp-bump mapping) gated on capability
   `INDEPENDENT_TEMP_AND_MODE_ON_UPDATE`; a live probe shows fw 1.9
   does **not** flip mode on the wire when only `{stemp, units}` is sent.
3. Mode change: `{mode: "manual"|"auto"|"off"|…}`; when the capability above
   is absent, MANUAL carries the temp too: `{mode, stemp, units}` (3-key!).
4. Profile temps: `{ice_temp, eco_temp, comf_temp, units}` (4-key, all
   temperature-category).
5. Lock: `{locked: bool}` ✔ single-key.

**Refined one-key rule (supersedes the absolute pin in the pre-contract notes):**
multi-key status POSTs are accepted **within a category** (temp-keys+units,
mode+stemp+units) — the app does this in production. The observed silent
drop happened on a **4-key mixed-category** body
(`{locked, stemp, units, mode}`). Integration's sequential single-key posts
remain the safe pattern; do not change without a live A/B probe.

Mode-change sequencing: before switching away from `boost`/`runback`, the app
first POSTs the deactivate for the previous mode, then activates the new one
(`deactivatePreviousMode()` → `activateMode()`). Not applicable to plain htr
without those modes active.

`modified_auto`: exists as an app-level mode value; on fw 1.9 the device does
not reflect it on the wire when not explicitly sent. Sending it explicitly
(the §4 item 2 body) DOES engage it (live-probed 2026-09-28): the mode flips, the heater follows, and the
override persists until reverted with `{"mode": "auto"}` (no self-revert
within a 60 s window; the app's UX reverts at the next differing programme
temperature). CONFIRMED by direct capture of the web app on this hardware
(2026-09-28): bumping the temp in auto posts exactly
`{"stemp":"20.5","units":"C","mode":"modified_auto"}` — the 3-key body is
the app's production behavior on these units. The HA integration now sends
this body for setpoints in auto, gated on `modified_auto_span` in setup
(the app's INDEPENDENT_TEMP_AND_MODE_ON_UPDATE capability is not
wire-visible).
Also: off-grid setpoints silently quantize to the 0.5 °C grid — round
before POSTing; the app's UI step is 0.5 °C / 1 °F (user-verified against
the app, 2026-09-28).


## 5. Schedule model (the scheduling feature's core)

- `prog.prog` = **7 day-arrays** (Mon..Sun), each holding **N profile-index
  ints**, one per slot: 24 slots @ 60 min (hourly, `prog_resolution: 0`), or
  48 @ 30 min when capability `MULTIPLE_SCHEDULE_RESOLUTIONS` is active
  (`prog_resolution: 1`).
- Profile index order (plain htr): **0=ICE, 1=ECO, 2=COMFORT**
  (`getIndexSortedScheduleProfiles()`); UI profile id → API index via
  `getApiScheduleProfile()` = index in that list (unknown → 0).
- UI schedule = per day, slots `{start, end, id}` in **minutes from midnight**,
  `id` = profile. Conversion to raw: expand each slot into
  `ceil((end-start)/slotMinutes)` repeated indices; pad the day to 24 h.
  Reconstruction (raw → UI): collapse runs of equal indices; last slot ends
  1440.
- Resolution change: `setScheduleMethod(method)` → **setup POST
  `{prog_resol: m, prog_resolution: m}`** (2-key setup write; the app merges
  into the full setup first — merge rules as §3/setup).
- Temperature edit per profile: app clamps against neighbour profiles
  (`scheduleTemperatureOffset`) then sends the 4-key status post (§4 item 4).
  Simpler equivalent: single-key posts per temp key + units — **verify one
  variant live before relying on it**.
- Websocket: schedule changes arrive as `/htr/<addr>/prog` update frames
  (observed live) — the integration's websocket handler must
  store `prog` frames like `status` frames (verify current handling during
  implementation).

## 6. Discrepancies & open items (app vs library vs integration)

History: the adjudications below were made against the pre-rewrite stack
(the retired library plus the integration); the CLOSED rows stay as the
record, and the still-open rows are marked.

| # | Item | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | Away write: app `{away, enabled}`; integration `{away}` only | **CLOSED (2026-09-27, live)**: server honours both shapes — `enabled` tolerated, not required; library defaults it like the app since 2.6.0 |
| D2 | `POST/GET .../prog` absent from library | **CLOSED (2.6.0)**: `get_node_prog`/`set_node_prog` in `session.py` (+ sync `Session`, `NodeProg`, websocket helper, CLI) |
| D3 | Multi-key status semantics: pin refined (category-scoped, not absolute) | **CLOSED (2026-09-27)**: the pre-contract notes were rewritten to the category-scoped rule |
| D4 | Dedicated `/mode`, `/lock`, `/boost`, `/prog_temps` endpoints unused by library | **CLOSED (2.6.0)**: implemented to spec; boost marked **unverified-on-hardware** (factory boost-disabled units) |
| D5 | `prog_resolution` / `MULTIPLE_SCHEDULE_RESOLUTIONS` on fw-1.9 htr unverified | **PARTIALLY CLOSED (2026-09-27, live)**: this family's `factory_options` has **no `prog_resolution` key** — resolution not readable from setup; observed schedule is 24 hourly slots. 48-slot mode unverified (no capable hardware) |
| D6 | No live `GET .../prog` sample exists | **CLOSED (2026-09-27)**: captured from heater 5 + all nodes; the shape is recorded in `api-contract.md` §5.3 (the repo ships setup/status live fixtures, not the prog week) |
| D7 | Local-LAN API (HelkiDigest) — no vendor client exists; dead end by design | CLOSED | summarized in the appendix below |

## Appendix — Local API of the box (informational, CLOSED)

`http://<box>:80`: `GET /info` open (devid, timezone); everything else 401 +
`WWW-Authenticate: HelkiDigest <16 printable-ASCII bytes, hex-encoded>`;
response token = 32 chars, length-validated only; nonce reusable;
wrong-but-well-formed → 401 + fresh nonce; malformed → 400. Routes exist
behind auth (`/mgr/nodes`, `/dev_data`, `/htr/N/*`, `/mgr/cloud`,
`/mgr/status`, `/mgr/away_status`, `/mgr/rtc/time`, `/mgr/discovery`, …) —
mirroring the cloud API. `/mgr/wifi/scan|network|start` exist only in SoftAP
provisioning mode (open, no auth; body `{essid, pass|encrypted_pass}`).
No vendor client implements the digest (web SPA, APK dex and JS all lack it)
— the box is cloud-tethered; local control would require impersonating the
provider endpoint. Investigation closed 2026-09-26.
