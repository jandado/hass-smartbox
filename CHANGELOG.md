# Changelog

## 3.1.0 (2026-11-12)

Stable release of the library-split line.

### Changed

- The protocol and core layers now come from the separate `smartbox`
  library, pinned in `manifest.json` to `v3.0.0`. The vendored copies are
  removed; HACS/Home Assistant installs the requirement automatically.
  Manual installs need the matching `smartbox` package.
- The library dependency is Home Assistant-free and can be used on its own.
- No configuration, entity-id or history changes are required.

### Fixed

- Climate entities now provide `native_temperature_unit`,
  `native_current_temperature` and `native_target_temperature`. The
  deprecated `temperature_unit`, `current_temperature` and
  `target_temperature` overrides are gone on HA 2026.11+, removing the
  startup warnings; the old names remain only on older supported versions.
- The program card maps the wire's Sunday-first day keys correctly and
  follows the Home Assistant user's first-day-of-week setting. The schedule
  sensor uses the same mapping for the current profile and next boundary.
- Heater devices are linked to their box in the device registry, with the
  box listing its heaters under Connected devices and each heater showing
  Connected via the box.

### Added

- The manifest declares `"loggers": ["smartbox"]`, so the integration's
  Enable debug logging option and Home Assistant 2026.11's Live log include
  the `smartbox.protocol` and `smartbox.core` messages.
- A bundled Lovelace program card, `custom:smartbox-program-card`, with a
  seven-day grid, profile brushes, drag/touch editing, undo, reset, copy-day,
  equal-slot merging and a native discard confirmation. It loads as an extra
  frontend module; no separate HACS dashboard item or Lovelace resource is
  needed.

## 3.0.0 (2026-11-03)

First stable release of the 3.0.0 line, published from the maintained fork.
The original integration and 2.6.x line are by Alberto Tudela and the
upstream contributors. The `3.0.0-rc.4` functional code is unchanged; only
release metadata and documentation changed. This section lists the changes
since the 2.6.0 release.

### Breaking

- **socket_io fallback removed.** Only the `ws_user` websocket transport is
  supported. An account whose host does not serve it cannot work with 3.0.0
  and should stay on 2.6.x. The public-app check re-run on 2026-11-03 still
  found the EHC and Electrorad apps on the legacy `socket.io` bundle, and
  unauthenticated `/api/v2/ws_user` probes returned 404 on both API hosts.
- **Library dependency removed.** The `smartbox` library is no longer a
  runtime dependency; `smartbox_protocol` and `smartbox_core` ship inside
  the integration, and `manifest.json` has empty `requirements`. Users of
  the library's CLI tooling install it separately.
- **`SMARTBOX_WS_BACKEND` removed.** The source constant disappeared with
  the socket_io fallback. It was never a config-entry option, so there is
  no setting to delete.

### Upgrade from 2.6.x

- Existing config entries are reused; entity registry identities, areas and
  history are preserved. No re-add is required.
- The duty-cycle and RTC-drift sensors are disabled by default for newly
  created entities. Existing enabled entities keep their state.
- If setup reports `unsupported`, the account needs `socket_io` and should
  stay on 2.6.x.
- After a restart, entities may briefly show Unavailable until the first
  websocket snapshot arrives.

### Architecture and transport

- Rebuilt as a three-layer stack: `smartbox_protocol` →
  `smartbox_core` → the Home Assistant adapter.
- Setup probes the API host once and uses the vendor apps' `ws_user`
  websocket; the scheduled token refresh cuts the socket for a few seconds
  every ~4 hours and reconnects with a fresh token.
- A feed outage is visible: when the socket closes and no frame arrives
  within 10 seconds, entities render Unavailable and the outage is logged
  once. An open socket may stay quiet for minutes without being treated as
  down.
- A repair issue reports a host that keeps refusing the `ws_user`
  handshake; the integration re-probes it in place behind a capped backoff.
- Node availability derives from both the status and setup lost markers.
- Every node write arms a confirmation window. Entities apply the write
  optimistically and turn Unavailable if the device does not confirm; the
  6-second countdown starts when the POST returns, so a token refresh or a
  slow request cannot expire it mid-flight.
- REST GET and token-grant retries use capped exponential backoff with
  one-sided jitter.

### Entities and climate

- The 2.6.0 entity surface (climate, sensors, binary sensor, switches,
  numbers, selects, services) plus the node-level power-limit number and
  “no node power limit” switch that PMO nodes expose. Existing registry
  identities are unchanged.
- The Away switch refreshes climate cards immediately, and the “no power
  limit” switch reports when it has nothing to restore.
- The schedule sensor follows the websocket; its old 15-minute REST
  refetch is gone.
- Model-code derivation matches the app's PID slice, and the charge-level
  sensor reads the live `/version` slot so a later frame can correct it.
- Programme temperature writes clamp per-profile, apply the ice/eco/comfort
  offset, and correct the 4-key `/status` body after max-limit changes.
  The `max_stemp_limit "0.0"` write is accepted and persists, and the
  sentinel enforces the limit.
- Boost follows the vendor app's `boost_config` dispatch: 1/2 use the
  status/setup path, 3 (full) posts `/boost_mode`. Full-boost nodes expose
  Runback and Advanced boost as climate presets, with `boost_mode`,
  `boost_end_time` and `boost_remaining_minutes` attributes and a
  `smartbox.set_boost_mode` service. Runback uses the node's own limits;
  `extra_options.version >= 2` stores boost/runback temperatures in
  Celsius.
- An unmodelled firmware mode or `selected_temp` renders an unknown HVAC
  mode or preset and logs one warning per distinct value. Malformed server
  numbers read as unknown instead of raising.
- The duty-cycle and RTC-drift sensors are diagnostic and opt-in.

### Membership

- A heater or box added to the account after setup is created in place,
  whether the snapshot or `/mgr/nodes` reports it. A lagging identity is
  retried, and a failed refresh falls back to a repair issue asking for a
  reload.
- A heater or box removed from the account is removed after a grace and a
  fresh full-account confirmation. A node that merely lost power stays
  Unavailable and is not removed. Recorder history and long-term statistics
  are kept, and a re-paired heater restores the same device and entity IDs,
  area and history. An unconfirmed device can be deleted from its device
  page.

### Consumption statistics

- Reworked the existing consumption-statistics import; this is not a new
  data source. Hourly rows are built in UTC, the import skips cleanly when
  the recorder is absent, transient failures retry with backoff, and
  first-setup progress is tracked in diagnostics.

### Diagnostics, system health and errors

- Diagnostics report the supervised `ws_user` transport, supervision state,
  token expiry, feed state, engine store, armed deadlines and
  statistics-import progress.
- Diagnostics redact the account's device and home identifiers, serials and
  registry unique IDs. Device IDs become stable `device_N` labels, so the
  engine, membership and statistics sections stay correlatable.
- System health reports every configured account, counts accounts without a
  live runtime, labels them by reseller and index, and bounds the API
  version and health reads independently.
- Service and entity errors are translated (de/en/es/fr). Invalid input is a
  `ServiceValidationError`; a state restriction or failed write, including a
  protocol failure from an entity action, is a translated
  `HomeAssistantError`.
- The existing account's username or password can be corrected without
  deleting the integration entry, so existing entities and history are
  kept. Changing the reseller, or switching accounts on an entry that
  already has entities, requires removing and re-adding the integration.
- The integration title is “Smartbox”.

### Documentation and quality

- The README documents practical use cases, known limitations, the
  supported-reseller table and HACS installation.
- The quality-scale audit is complete except the `brands` submission, which
  is postponed; the manifest keeps `"quality_scale": "custom"`.
  `PARALLEL_UPDATES` is declared per platform.
- `tools/live_probe.py` verifies wire behaviour against real hardware, and
  the in-repo records (`docs/api-contract.md`, `docs/webapi-spec.md`,
  `docs/api-ws-user.md`) keep every wire claim and its provenance
  self-contained.
- The Tevolve tenant is selectable; its live login remains unverified.
