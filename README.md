Home Assistant integration for Haverland (and other brands) heating smartboxes.

## Requirements

* Home Assistant **2026.5.0 or newer**.
* A Smartbox account with one of the [supported resellers](#supported-resellers).
* [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) for the recommended installation; the manual route works without it.

## Supported resellers

The setup flow offers these providers. The link identifies the brand/account;
every provider dials the same API host (`users-api.helki.com`), so the link is
not the integration's endpoint. Several names share a tenant/backend with
another brand, as noted.

| Brand | Provider link | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Helki | https://app.helki.com/ | Generic Helki/Smartbox account |
| Lucht LHZ | https://smartcontrol.lucht-lhz.de/ | |
| Electric Heating Company | https://control.electric-heatingcompany.co.uk/ | Legacy socket.io web app (2026-10-20) |
| Climastar | https://avantwifi.climastar.es/ | |
| Elnur | https://remotecontrol.elnur.es/ | |
| Valderoma | https://wifi.valderoma.fr/ | Shares the Climastar tenant |
| iHeat Control | https://app.iheatcontrol.com/ | Shares the Electrorad tenant |
| HJM | https://api.calorhjm.com/ | Configured brand link |
| Electrorad | https://app.controls-electrorad.co.uk/ | Legacy socket.io web app (2026-10-20) |
| Haverland | https://i2control.haverland.com/ | |
| Tevolve | https://tevolve.termoweb.net/ | Selectable; live login unverified |
| Technotherm | https://ttiapp.technotherm.com/ | Shares the Lucht LHZ tenant |
| SmartControl | https://app.smart-control.eu/ | Shares the Lucht LHZ tenant |

Accounts whose backend only serves the retired `socket_io` transport need
2.6.x; the 3.0 line requires `ws_user`. The public web-app check above is a
hint: the other eleven provider apps ship the `ws_user` client, while the EHC
and Electrorad apps still serve the legacy `socket.io` app. The setup probe is
authoritative for an individual account — if it reports `unsupported`, stay on
2.6.x. See the websocket warning below.

## Installation

### Using HACS (Recommended)

1. Add this repository to your HACS [custom repositories] as an **Integration**.
1. Search for and install "Smartbox" in HACS.
1. Restart Home Assistant.


### Manually Copy Files

1. Open your Home Assistant configuration directory (where `configuration.yaml` lives).
1. Create `custom_components/` if it does not exist.
1. Copy the **whole** `custom_components/smartbox/` directory from this repository (or the release archive) into it, preserving `smartbox_protocol/`, `smartbox_core/`, `brand/`, `translations/`, and the JSON/YAML files.
1. Restart Home Assistant


### Finally

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start setting up a new integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=smartbox)


### Removal

1. Remove the Smartbox entry in **Settings → Devices & services**.
1. Remove the custom repository and the integration in HACS (if installed that way), or delete `custom_components/smartbox/` for a manual install.
1. Restart Home Assistant.


## Configuration

You will need the following items of information:
* Name of your reseller
* Your username and password used for the mobile app/web app.

If there is an issue during the process or authentication, the errors will be displayed.

### Additional Options
You can also specify the following options (although they have reasonable defaults)

#### Consumption history options
We are currently getting the [consumption](#consumption) of device through the API and we inject it in statistics and TotalConsumption sensor
* `start` : we will get the last 3 years of consumption and set the option to auto.
* `auto` : every 15 minutes, we get the last 24 hours.
* `off` : stop the automatic collect. We will still update the sensor's value every 15 minutes.

#### Reseller logo
By default, each entity has its own icon based on its type.
You can activate this option to display the logo of the reseller instead.

#### Timedelta between update power
If you have a [Dedicated energy monitor](#dedicated-energy-monitor), we get the current power each 60 seconds by default.
You can update this time with this option (minimum 1 second).
> [!NOTE]
> Be careful with this option; reduce the number little by little to see if any instability occurs.

### Architecture

Since 3.0.0 the integration runs on a purpose-built three-layer stack
(the `smartbox` library is no longer a runtime dependency: its
reseller table, node-type enum and backoff helper are absorbed into
the integration):

* `smartbox_protocol` — auth (token manager), the REST client, the
  `ws_user` websocket transport and the named write operations.
* `smartbox_core` — the versioned state store + engine: snapshot
  ingestion, websocket-frame merging, availability tracking and
  write-confirmation windows.
* `custom_components/smartbox` — the HA adapter: config flow, entity
  platforms, diagnostics.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the layer rules, the repository
map, and the read and write flows.

### Websocket transport

Status updates arrive over the `ws_user` channel (the vendor web apps'
transport): ONE connection for the whole account. A client-side 60-second
heartbeat, alongside the proxy's own PINGs, supervises the session — the
periodic "Server has stopped communicating" aborts of the legacy
per-device `socket_io` transport disappear. The server cuts the socket at
the access token's 4-hour expiry (~4-second outage while it reconnects
with a fresh token); that is the steady state, by design.

> [!WARNING]
> **BREAKING:** the socket_io fallback is GONE. Every reseller key
> dials the same host (`users-api.helki.com`); the key selects the
> tenant's credentials, serial id and referer, not a host. The setup
> probes `ws_user` once with a fresh token, and a host that does not
> serve it cannot work with this version (the config entry fails with
> an "unsupported" error). `ws_user` is live-verified on that shared
> host; tenant deployments other than the probed one are unverified,
> not known-bad. Accounts whose backend only serves socket_io must
> stay on 2.6.x; the legacy EHC and Electrorad web apps are the known
> examples from the 2026-10-20 public-app check. Transient probe
> trouble (a 5xx-ing or unreachable host) retries via the normal
> `ConfigEntryNotReady` retry — a transport verdict is never inferred
> from transient trouble.

The transport is visible in Settings → Devices → diagnostics as
`runtime.transport`.

### Write confirmation

Writes to a node arm a confirmation window: the write is applied
optimistically in Home Assistant, and a confirming frame from the node
within the window confirms it. If no confirmation arrives (e.g. the
heater is unreachable), the node's entities turn Unavailable — the
same behavior the vendor app shows when a command does not land.

## Features

### Heaters (climate)
Heater node types (`htr`, `acm` and `htr_mod`) are modelled as Home
Assistant Climate entities.

* `htr` and `acm` (accumulator) nodes
  * Supported modes: 'manual' and 'auto'
  * Supported presets: 'home' and 'away'
* `htr_mod`
  * Supported modes: 'manual', 'auto', 'self_learn' and 'presence'
  * Supported presets: 'comfort', 'eco', 'frost', 'schedule', 'self_learn' and 'activity'

Every heater also exposes the 'away' and 'boost' presets (boost where
the device supports it) and the `OFF` HVAC mode. The modes and presets
for `htr_mod` heaters are mapped as follows:

| htr\_mod mode | htr\_mod selected_temp | HA HVAC mode | HA preset   |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| manual        | comfort                | HEAT         | COMFORT     |
|               | eco                    | HEAT         | ECO         |
|               | ice                    | HEAT         | FROST       |
| auto          | *                      | AUTO         | SCHEDULE    |
| self\_learn   | *                      | AUTO         | SELF\_LEARN |
| presence      | *                      | AUTO         | ACTIVITY    |

The target temperature step is 0.5 °C / 1.0 °F. On the fw-1.9 `htr`
family, the maximum target temperature is clamped to the node's
`max_stemp_limit` when the device advertises one.

If a heater or box is paired to the account after the integration has set
up, the snapshot triggers a fresh REST identity read and the entity builders
add the new device and node entities in place. A lagging identity is retried
with a short backoff; if it still fails, a repair issue names the pending
nodes and asks for a reload.

When the account no longer lists a heater or box, the integration confirms
the absence with a fresh full account read after a short grace period, then
removes the device and its entities. Recorder history and long-term
statistics are kept, and pairing the heater again restores the same device
and entity IDs (with their area, name and history). A member the integration
cannot confirm, for example while the vendor API is unreachable, can still
be deleted from its device page.

**Boost:** the Boost switch/preset follows the vendor app's
`boost_config` dispatch. Configuration `1` and `2` use the status/setup
path; configuration `3` (full) posts `/boost_mode`
(`{active, mode, temp?, time?}`). The full path is app-evidenced; live
acceptance on a full-boost unit is still pending.

On a full-boost node, **Runback** and **Advanced boost** (boost until the
next schedule change) appear as climate presets when the node's status
advertises them. Runback uses its own lower/upper temperature limits while
active. The boost/runback temperature and duration number entities are
**defaults** used at activation; while a mode is running, the climate
target is its active temperature, and the climate entity's `boost_mode`,
`boost_end_time`, and `boost_remaining_minutes` attributes show the active
mode and time left. Use `smartbox.set_boost_mode` to edit a running mode's
duration or to select advanced-slot/runback explicitly.

## Services

The integration registers three domain services, also available under
**Developer tools → Actions**.

### `smartbox.set_schedule`

Target a schedule sensor (entity, device, or area). The `schedule` field is
a day-keyed object (`"0"`..`"6"`, Monday..Sunday); each value is that day's
list of profile slots (`0` = frost, `1` = eco, `2` = comfort). Omitted days
keep their current programme.

```yaml
action: smartbox.set_schedule
target:
  entity_id: sensor.living_room_schedule
data:
  schedule:
    "0": [0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0,
          0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]
```

### `smartbox.set_boost_mode`

Target a Smartbox climate entity. Activates one of the full-boost modes
(`temp_and_time`, `max_temp_fixed_time`, `advanced_slot`, `runback`) or
deactivates the running mode. `temperature` is in the climate entity's
unit; `duration` is in minutes. This is the service path for editing a
running boost/runback duration and for modes the presets do not cover.

```yaml
action: smartbox.set_boost_mode
target:
  entity_id: climate.living_room
data:
  mode: runback
  temperature: 20.0
  duration: 60
```

### `smartbox.set_boost_params`

Target a boost temperature or boost duration number entity. Both fields are
optional, but at least one is required; the temperature is in the target
entity's unit.

```yaml
action: smartbox.set_boost_params
target:
  entity_id: number.living_room_boost_temperature
data:
  temperature: 21.5
  duration: 120
```

### Node availability
Heaters the box reports as unreachable (node-level `sync_status:
"lost"`) show as Unavailable on all of their entities, so a heater whose
power is cut is visible at a glance. Entities come back as Available
shortly after the node answers again.

### Sensors
* Temperature (current)
* Power (including PMO dedicated energy monitors)
* Duty cycle (`htr` nodes)
* Total consumption (energy, with recorder statistics import - see
  [Consumption](#consumption))
* Charge level (`acm` nodes)
* Boost end time (timestamp)
* Schedule (enum, per heater node)
* RTC clock drift (box-level, refreshed every 5 minutes)

### Binary sensor
One box-level connectivity sensor (per-node connectivity is shown
through the climate entities' availability instead).

### Switches
* Box level: away mode, "no power limit"
* Per node: window mode, true radiant, boost, child lock (keypad
  lockout), maximum temperature limit (remembers the last non-zero
  limit across Home Assistant restarts), "no node power limit" (on the
  PMO nodes whose setup carries the key)

### Numbers
* Box power limit (0 = no limit, max 60000)
* Per node: node power limit (PMO nodes whose setup carries the key),
  boost temperature, boost duration, away offset, maximum
  temperature, and programme temperatures (frost / eco / comfort, where
  the device reports them)

### Selects
* Per node: radiator priority (low / medium / high, fw-1.9 family
  only) — the device takes it into account itself when enforcing the
  box power limit

### Dedicated energy monitor
The PMO devices are available including the power limit entity.

### Consumption
The smartbox API is only giving the hourly consumption from a start and an end period of time.
You can't have real time consumption of a device and this consumption is always increasing.

At every beginning of an hour, during around 15/20 minutes, the API do not provide data for the current hour.
So we always ask for the last three hours and report the most recent counter in that window, so a missing hour cannot make the consumption drop.

Every 15 minutes, we are updating data sensor with the most recent data. You are able to see the consumption directly into the history graph of the sensor.

But to be sure we ensure the right data to the right hour, we also get the last 24 hours and upsert these data into statistics to avoid time difference and some data drop.
> [!TIP]
> If you don't want to upsert these 24 hours, you have to set the [option](#consumption-history-options) to `off`.

#### History
The first time we create a config entry (or when the [option](#consumption-history-options) of the config entry is set to `start`) we get the last 3 years of consumption.
As it is not possible to add it directly to the sensor data, we insert it into the statistics of the sensor.
So it let the energy dashboard working with the current and back history.


> [!TIP]
> If you want to reset all the data, you have to set the [option](#consumption-history-options) to `start`.

## FAQ
#### There is negative consumption in the energy dashboard
There might be a huge negative consumption in your energy dashboard. The consumption [history](#history) should deal with it. But sometimes it didn't work.
You have two options:
* Settings the [option](#consumption-history-options) to `start` : it will force load all data.
* Go to [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show your statistics developer tools.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/developer_statistics.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/developer_statistics/), select the total consumption entity, outliers and patch the negative value with 0.

#### My Reseller is not present in the list
If your reseller (which uses a smartbox) is not in the list, open a [Reseller Github issue] on this integration's tracker.

## Debugging

### Diagnostics

If there is an error and raise an issue in [Github issue], please attach the diagnostics of the entry :
* Go on [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show an integration.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/integration.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integration/?domain=smartbox)
* Click on the three dots of the config entry
* Download diagnostics

The diagnostics file is grouped by the question it answers:

| Block | What it tells you |
| --- | --- |
| `entry` | The redacted config entry: reseller key, with username, password, title and unique ID removed. |
| `runtime.transport` | Whether the websocket is running, the short-cycle and auth-rejection streaks, and the last close code/reason. |
| `runtime.supervision` | Whether the failure is terminal (`unsupported`, `auth_failed`, `terminal_error`) or still retrying. |
| `runtime.token_expiry` | When the current access token expires. |
| `runtime.feed` | Whether values are flowing, the reason and duration of a gap, the outage count, and the grace window. |
| `runtime.membership` | Nodes still awaiting materialization and whether the reload repair issue is raised. |
| `runtime.statistics_import` | Which first-setup imports are pending or completed, and the failure count, last error and remaining backoff. |
| `runtime.engine` | Raw device and node slots, plus the armed deadlines: the direct answer to “why is this entity unavailable?”. |
| `ws_user_recovery` | Whether the websocket repair issue is raised. |
| `hass_devices` / `hass_entities` | Home Assistant’s registry view: device identifiers, entity IDs and registry state. |

A `runtime: null` means the entry is failing or retrying setup: there is no
live client to inspect. Start with `entry`, `ws_user_recovery` and the Home
Assistant logs in that case.

### System health

You can see if all the smartbox component are available here [![Open your Home Assistant instance and show information about your system.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/system_health.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/system_health/)

### Logs
Debug logging can be enabled by increasing the log level for the
integration and its vendored protocol/core layers in the Home
Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```
 logger:
   ...
   logs:
     custom_components.smartbox: debug
     custom_components.smartbox.smartbox_protocol: debug
     custom_components.smartbox.smartbox_core: debug
   ...
```

See the [Home Assistant logger docs] for how to view the actual logs. Please
file a [Github issue] with any problems.

## Development / live probing

For wire investigation against the real hosts (without a live HA
deploy), `tools/live_probe.py` drives the vendored protocol layer from
the CLI. It needs YOUR OWN `.env` file at the repo root (gitignored)
with:

```
SMARTBOX_API_NAME=...
SMARTBOX_USERNAME=...
SMARTBOX_PASSWORD=...
```

(The reseller table supplies the Basic-auth/serial-id/referer values,
so no extra key is needed.) Tokens, credentials and device IDs are
masked in the output; a token is never printed - only its length,
expiry and claim facts are.

Commands:

- `uv run python tools/live_probe.py auth` — password grant + one
  refresh grant (rotation check).
- `... probe` — ws_user capability probe verdict.
- `... reads [--dev DEV_ID] [--node TYPE:ADDR]` — grouped devices,
  then per node the raw status/setup/version JSON (and
  `--samples-from/--samples-to` for the samples window).
- `... ws [--duration 60] [--heartbeat 60]` — subscribe the ws_user
  transport; event counts, bounded update previews, transport facts.
- `... write --dev DEV_ID --node TYPE:ADDR
  --i-know-this-writes-to-my-heater <op> ...` — the CLI's WriteApi ops
  (`set_mode`, `set_setpoint`, `engage_modified_auto`, `set_lock`,
  `set_boost`, `set_boost_mode`, `set_prog_temps`, `set_window_mode`,
  `set_true_radiant`, `set_away_offset`, `set_max_stemp_limit`,
  `set_priority`, `set_away`, `set_power_limit`,
  `set_node_power_limit`, `set_prog`); prints the exact body before
  sending, then GETs the affected resource (the server's read-through
  may lag several seconds and show the old value).
- `... all` — probe + reads (the daily sanity menu).
