"""Diagnostics for Smartbox Integration.

Everything debuggable comes from the runtime: the supervised ws_user
transport, the engine's terminal supervision state, the token expiry, the
engine store, and the deadlines that will flip a node Unavailable. Credential
material never reaches the store, so the entry dict is the only place
credentials can appear.

Account and device identifiers are redacted too: a ``dev_id`` also opens the
device websocket, and the home id, serials and registry deep links identify the
installation in a file users paste into public issues. Device ids are replaced
with stable ``device_N`` labels, so the engine, membership and statistics
sections stay correlatable without exposing the ids themselves.
