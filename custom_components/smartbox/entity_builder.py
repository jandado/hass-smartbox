"""Dynamic entity builders for nodes/devices discovered after setup.

Platforms create their entities once from the REST discovery identity. The
websocket snapshot can add membership later; this registry lets each platform
publish a builder that turns one discovered device or node into its entities.
The membership watcher refreshes identity, then hands the result here.

Builders return ``(entities, update_before_add)`` groups so a platform can keep
its per-entity fetch flags (the total-consumption sensor, for example). Known
sets are seeded from the setup identity: a previously seen node is never built
twice while it is present. A node confirmed removed is forgotten, so a later
reappearance is built again and HA can restore its deleted registry entries.
