"""Boundary normalization primitives for raw wire payloads.

The wire is stringly-typed where core wants typed values: numbers arrive as
strings (``"20.0"``), setpoints live on a 0.5 °C grid, RTC months are
0-indexed, and sync status distinguishes "lost" payloads. Core builds its typed
accessors on THESE primitives; the module stays small and dependency-free.

Open wire questions, documented rather than special-cased:

- RTC month indexing is assumed ``n + 1`` (September -> 8 -> 9); December
  (``n=11`` -> 12) is unverified live.
