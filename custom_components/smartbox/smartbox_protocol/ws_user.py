"""Real ``ws_user`` transport: one WebSocket per user, push-only.

The wire facts and the fallback doctrine live in docs/api-contract.md §4 and
docs/webapi-spec.md. What this module relies on:

- URL ``wss://<host>:443/api/v2/ws_user?token=...&user_id=...`` (see
  :func:`build_ws_url`). A FRESH token per connect is load-bearing: the endpoint
  validates ``exp`` at the handshake and cuts the socket exactly at token
  ``exp`` every ~4 h (close 1006).
- One ``{"event": "all_data"}`` message on open, re-sent (debounced) on
  ``should_sync``. The all_data reply is expected within
  ``_SNAPSHOT_TIMEOUT`` of connect (a socket that never delivers it is a
  wedged session, not a quiet one); afterwards liveness is the ``heartbeat``
  kwarg (server PINGs are auto-PONGed), data silence below
  ``_SILENCE_TIMEOUT`` is never a failure signal, and past it the socket is
  torn down as dead (see the constants).
- Backoff 1 s * 2^n with one-sided +0-20 % jitter, capped. Transient failures
  retry; only deterministic rejections (404/410, or >= 3 consecutive
  fresh-token 401/403s) raise ``TransportUnsupportedError``.
- Secrets hygiene: never log the URL, the token or frame bodies.

Writes are REST, never socket messages. ``check_ws_user_support`` is the
endpoint's own one-shot handshake probe.
