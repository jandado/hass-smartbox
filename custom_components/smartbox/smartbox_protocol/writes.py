"""Named write operations: the wire write rules as a named API.

Each op documents the body it posts. The rules they encode (live-verified;
canonical copies in docs/api-contract.md §5):

- ONE mutable key per status POST: multi-key bodies are silently PARTIALLY
  APPLIED (a ``{locked, stemp, mode}`` restore stored locked+mode and dropped
  stemp). The multi-key bodies this module sends are the app-shaped ones: the
  ``modified_auto`` engage body, the 4-key profile temps, and the htr_mod
  setpoint body (docs/api-contract.md §5.1), plus ``units`` alongside
  temperature fields.
- The app-shaped ``{stemp, units, mode: "modified_auto"}`` body engages the
  override ONLY when that mode is sent explicitly; a plain ``{stemp, units}``
  write in auto applies immediately but does not persist across programme
  transitions. Engaging is the CALLER's policy - it needs the node's mode and
  the setup's ``modified_auto_span``.
- Off-grid Celsius setpoints are quantized by the device, so the client rounds
  onto the 0.5 grid and formats ``.1f``; Fahrenheit quantizes to whole degrees
  (the vendor app's F grid is integral, docs/api-contract.md §5.2).
- ``"0.0"`` is the sentinel for a disabled ``max_stemp_limit``; remembering the
  last non-zero value is the CALLER's concern.
- Setup and prog writes re-post the WHOLE object, because the API wipes unknown
  keys otherwise. Prog merges at DAY level (string keys ``"0"``..``"6"``); a
  bare 7-array list is rejected with 400. The merge base is the caller's
  :class:`SlotReader` when it holds the body: a successful write is not visible
  to GET for several seconds (docs/api-contract.md §5.4), so merging over a
  REST read would post a previous write's key back at its pre-write value. A
  GET is the fallback while the store has no body yet.
- A write is confirmed by the frame the server pushes, never by a GET: each op
  reports what it posted (:class:`PostedWrite`), and core decides what proves
  it landed.
- Writes are NEVER blind-retried on transient failures (the server may
  have applied the write): single POST attempt, errors per the client's
  error contract (4xx -> ``SmartboxError``, 5xx/network/timeout ->
  ``TransportUnavailableError``, one 401 -> invalidate + re-auth +
  resend).
