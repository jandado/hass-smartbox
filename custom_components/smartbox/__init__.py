"""The Smartbox integration.

Component lifecycle. The protocol and core layers own auth, transport and
state; this module wires them per config entry and keeps the HA-facing
behavior stable (setup/unload/reload, reauth, in-place ws_user recovery,
diagnostics).

Setup is AuthConfig -> TokenManager (via the client) -> SmartboxClient ->
SmartboxEngine -> ws_user probe -> identity discovery -> WsUserTransport ->
supervise -> monitor -> platforms. Entity identity comes from
:mod:`.identity` (plain REST reads); all state reads and writes go through
the engine.
