"""Versioned domain state for the core layer.

The store is VERSIONED RAW STATE: wire payloads are kept as plain dicts exactly
as delivered (no validation, no model classes), and typed accessors are built
on ``smartbox_protocol.values`` by consumers. Every container is replaced
copy-on-write, so a reference to a previous revision stays valid forever and
everything inside a state object is read-only.

Revisions are per object, not per field:

- ``NodeState.revision`` counts updates that changed at least one of the node's
  status/setup/prog/version slots (starts 0). A frame changing two slots bumps
  it once and emits one change event per slot, all carrying the new revision; an
  accepted write's optimistic merge bumps it too.
- ``DeviceState.revision`` is the same for the device-level slots. Per-node
  merges rebuild the owning ``DeviceState`` without bumping it.
