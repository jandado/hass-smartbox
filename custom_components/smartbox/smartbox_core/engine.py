"""Core engine: snapshot ingestion, update merge, change notifications, writes.

``engine.supervise(transport)`` makes the engine the transport's handler,
driving the versioned store in :mod:`smartbox_core.state`. Merges are
synchronous and copy-on-write; the changes one frame produces are awaited in
order, one per changed slot.

Ordering contract - rules a reader must not reorder:

1. Per frame: merge, then run availability/confirmation on the RAW frame (a
   deduped frame still confirms a write), then notify. Node and device changes
   come first and feed changes last, so a frame that ends an outage never
   reports the recovery before the data it carried.
2. Data changes bump a revision: a frame, a snapshot entry, an optimistic write
   merge. Availability is derived state, so an availability flip changes
   ``NodeState.available`` without a bump.
3. Dedup is exact value-equality per slot: a value-equal payload is absorbed,
   every distinct value forwarded. The server does push duplicates.
4. A lost-marked payload is availability evidence, never slot data. It starts
   the Unavailable window and leaves the stored body alone, so an outage cannot
   blank an entity's last known values.
5. Write confirmation and lost windows belong to
   :class:`smartbox_core.deadlines.NodeDeadlines`: at most one pending write
   per node, a lost window that repeats never extend, and a frame that
   confirms only when it carries the keys the write set at those values. A
   frame that was already in flight (still carrying the pre-write value)
   neither confirms the write nor keeps the timeout from running; it still
   merges, and the write's own echo corrects the store moments later.
6. Every node deadline (write confirmation, lost window) is served by ONE
   timer, re-armed by ``_schedule`` on every change, so a superseded or removed
   deadline needs no cancellation.
7. ``stop()`` cancels the timer and refuses new writes; a later ``supervise()``
   starts a fresh run (the feed monitor re-arms).

The wire-shape rules the merges apply are pure functions in
:mod:`smartbox_core.merging`; feed liveness is :mod:`smartbox_core.feed`.
