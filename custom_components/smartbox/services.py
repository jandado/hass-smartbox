"""Domain services: registration, validation and target dispatch.

The three services are domain-global. Each entry publishes its service-capable
entities on ``runtime.services``; the handlers fan out across every loaded
entry, so a call reaches the same entity set regardless of which entry loaded
first. Registration happens once, from the entry lifecycle, and removal
happens when the last loaded entry goes away.

Target resolution is deliberately the integration's own: Home Assistant's
entity-service helper filters unavailable entities out, while these services
still attempt a write when the user targets one, matching the vendor app's
behavior. The handlers keep their exact messages here; error localization is a
separate change.

All three services act only on the call's target. Home Assistant does not
require a target for a manually registered service, so
:func:`require_service_target` rejects a call that resolves to nothing instead
of reporting a silent no-op.
